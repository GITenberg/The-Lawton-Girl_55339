    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;&ldquo;AND YET YOU KNEW!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hessaly! Ten
      minutes for refreshments!&rdquo; called out the brisk young colored porter,
      advancing up the aisle of the drawing-room car, whisk-broom in hand.
      &ldquo;Change cahs foh Thanksgiving turkey <i>and</i> cranberry sauce,&rdquo; he
      added, upon humorous after-thought, smiling broadly as he spoke, and
      chuckling to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This friendly remark was addressed in confidence to a group of three
      persons at the forward end of the car, who began preparations for the halt
      as the clanking of the wheels beneath them grew more measured, and the
      carriage trembled and lurched under the pressure of the brakes. But the
      cheery grin which went with it was exclusively directed to the two ladies
      who rose now from their arm-chairs, and who gently relaxed their features
      in amused response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the porter was moved only by the comeliness of these faces and
      their gracious softening, or whether he was aware that they were patrician
      countenances, so to speak, and belonged to Mrs. and Miss Minster, persons
      of vast wealth and importance and considerable stockholders in this very
      railroad, is not clear. But he made a great bustle over getting their
      parcels down from the racks overhead, and helping them to don their outer
      garments. He smoothed the rich fur of their sealskin cloaks with almost
      affectionate strokes of his coffee-colored palms, and made a pile of their
      belongings on the next seat with an exaggerated show of dexterity and
      zeal. This done, he turned for a cursory moment to the young man who
      constituted the third member of the group, peremptorily pulled up the
      collar of his overcoat to the top of his ears, and was back again with his
      arms full of the ladies&rsquo; bundles as the train came to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, ladies,&rdquo; he said, marching jauntily under his burden toward the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bid you good-day, Mr. Boyce,&rdquo; said the elder of the women,
      speaking with somewhat formal politeness, but offering her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, sir,&rdquo; the younger said simply, with a little inclination of the
      head, but with no &ldquo;Mr. Boyce,&rdquo; and no proffer of her gloved fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man murmured &ldquo;so delighted to have had the privilege&rdquo; between
      low answering bows, and then stood watching the two fur-draped figures
      move to the door and disappear, with a certain blankness of expression on
      his face which seemed to say that he had hoped for a more cordial
      leave-taking. Then he smiled with reassurance, folded up and pocketed his
      thin car-cap, adjusted his glossy silk hat carefully, and proceeded to tug
      out his own valise. It was a matter of some difficulty to get the cumbrous
      bag down off the high icy steps to the ground. It was even more
      disagreeable to carry it along when he had got it down, and after a few
      paces he let it fall with a grunt of vexation, and looked about him for
      assistance. &ldquo;How much better they do these things in Europe!&rdquo; was what he
      thought as he looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long he had been journeying over a snowbound country&mdash;with
      white-capped houses, white-frozen streams, white-tufted firs,
      white-mantled fields and roads and hillsides, forever dodging one another
      in the dissolving panorama before his window. The train drawn up for the
      moment behind him might have come in from the North Pole, so completely
      laden with snow was every flat surface&mdash;of roof and beam, of platform
      and window-frame&mdash;presented by the dark line of massive coaches. Yet
      it seemed to him that there was more snow, more bleak and cheerless
      evidence of winter, here in his native Thessaly, than he had seen anywhere
      else. It was characteristic, too, he felt, that nobody should appear to
      care how much inconvenience this snow caused. There was but an
      indifferently shovelled path leading from where he stood, across the open
      expanse of side-tracks to the old and dingy dépôt beyond&mdash;cleared for
      the use of such favored passengers as might alight from the drawing-room
      section of the train. Those who had arrived in the ordinary cars at the
      rear were left to flounder through the smoke-begrimed drifts as best they
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foremost of these unconsidered travellers were coming up, red and
      angry with the exertion of carrying their own luggage, and plunging
      miserably along through the great ridges of discolored snow heaped between
      the tracks, when Mr. Boyce&rsquo;s impatient eye fell upon somebody he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello there, Lawton!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Come here and help me with this
      infernal bag, won&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom he called had been gazing down the yard at the advancing
      wayfarers. He looked up now, hesitated for a moment, then came forward
      slowly, shuffling through the snow to the path. He was a middle-aged,
      thin, and round-shouldered man, weak and unkempt as to face and hair and
      beard, with shabby clothes and no overcoat. Although he wore mittens, he
      still from force of habit had his hands plunged half-way into his trousers
      pockets. Even where it would have been easy to step over the intermittent
      drifts and mounds at the sides of the tracks, he shiftlessly pushed his
      feet through them instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Hod!&rdquo; he said slowly, with a kind of melancholy hesitation, &ldquo;is
      that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Boyce ignored the foolish question, and indicated the valise
      with a nod of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d get that thing down to the house, Ben. And take these checks
      for my trunks, too, will you, and see that they&rsquo;re brought down. Where is
      that expressman, anyway? Why isn&rsquo;t he here, on hand, attending to his
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I can, Hod,&rdquo; said the man without an overcoat, idly
      kicking into a heap of mingled cinders and snow with his wet, patched
      boots, and glancing uneasily down the yard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m down here a-waitin&rsquo;&mdash;for&mdash;that
      is to say, I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; else to do. Prob&rsquo;ly you can get some other
      fellow outside the deepo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boyce&rsquo;s answer to this was to add a bright half-dollar to the brass
      baggage-checks he already held in his hand. The coin was on the top, and
      Ben Lawton could not help looking at it. The temptation was very great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to stay here, you know,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;Fact is, honest Injun! I
      <i>got</i> to stay here! I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for&mdash;somebody a-comin&rsquo; in on
      this train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can look, can&rsquo;t you, and do this too? There&rsquo;s no hurry about
      the things. If they&rsquo;re home two hours hence it will be time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, it might be so as I could do it, later on,&rdquo; said Lawton,
      taking one of his hands from his pocket and stretching it tentatively
      toward the money. Then a second thought prompted him to waver, and he drew
      back the hand, muttering feebly: &ldquo;Then, again, it might be so as I
      couldn&rsquo;t do it. You <i>better</i> get somebody else. And yet&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;p&rsquo;raps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boyce settled the question by briskly reaching down for his bag. &ldquo;All
      right! Please yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no more time to waste with
      you. I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he had fairly lifted the valise from the ground, the irresolute
      Lawton made up his mind. &ldquo;Put her down again, Hod,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage
      it somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the half-dollar in his mittened hand, and tossed it gently up and
      down on the striped blue and white surface of yarn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first money
      I&rsquo;ve earned for over a week,&rdquo; he remarked, as if in self-defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke, a young woman in black who had been wandering about in
      the dépôt yard came running excitedly up to him. She gave a little
      inarticulate cry of recognition as she drew near. He turned, saw her, and
      in a bewildered way opened his arms. She dropped her bundles and bandbox
      heedlessly into the snow, and threw herself upon his breast, hiding her
      face on his threadbare coat, and sobbing audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boyce had been entirely unprepared for this demonstration, and looked
      wonderingly upon the couple who stood in the path before him. After a
      moment or two of silent inspection he made as if to pass them, but they
      did not move. The girl still hid her face, although she had ceased to
      weep, and Lawton bent his head down over hers, with tears in his eyes and
      his gaze fixed vaguely on the snow beyond her, while he tenderly patted
      her shoulder with the hand that did not hold the half-dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, Ben,&rdquo; Mr. Boyce called out. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just let me pass,
      I&rsquo;ll walk on. Have the things there by five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of this voice, the girl raised her head. She turned
      now, her tear-stained face luminous with a deep, wrathful emotion, and
      looked at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man did not for more than an instant try to meet this glance.
      His cheek flushed and his eyes sought the ground. He lifted his hand with
      a hurried, awkward gesture toward his hat, made a hasty plunge around them
      through the snow, and walked swiftly away past the gate into the dépôt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s intent gaze followed the retiring Mr. Boyce until he
      disappeared. Then it shifted suddenly and fell upon the face of Ben
      Lawton, from whose embrace she had now withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man made no effort whatsoever to brave its searching and
      reproachful inquiry. He balanced the half-dollar on his mitten&rsquo;s edge,
      watched the exercise with a piteously futile pretence of interest, and
      looked as if he was about to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;things&rsquo; were those he spoke of, father?&rdquo; she asked, after a long
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers who had temporarily left the train for the doubtful solace
      of the refreshment counter were beginning now to return. Some of them
      jostled past the couple who stood blocking the narrow path; and one of
      these, a stout and choleric man in a silk skull-cap and a fur-lined
      overcoat, brusquely kicked the big valise out of the way, overturning it
      in the snow. Lawton had not found the courage necessary for a complete
      explanation. He bent over now, set the bag on its bottom again, and made
      partial answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is one of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy train, snow-capped and sombre, began to draw out of the yard.
      The two Lawtons stood and silently watched it unfold its length&mdash;saw
      first the broad, plate-glass panes of the drawing-room and sleeping cars,
      with their luxurious shadows and glimpses of well-groomed heads and costly
      stuffs behind, glide slowly, sedately by; then, more rapidly, the
      closer-set windows of the yellow, common cars, through the steam on which
      visions of hats and faces dimly crowded; and last, the diminishing rear
      platform, with its solitary brakeman vehemently whirling the horizontal
      wheel of the brake&mdash;grow small, then indistinct, then vanish
      altogether. A sense of desertion, of having been left behind, seemed to
      brood over the old clapboarded dépôt like a cloud, darkening the ashen
      masses of snow round about and chilling the very air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter looked once more at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to carry <i>his</i> things!&rdquo; she said, with a stern,
      masterful inflection in her voice, and with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope-to-die, Jess, I tried as hard as I could to get out of it&mdash;made
      all sorts of excuses,&rdquo; Lawton pleaded, shrinking meantime from her gaze,
      and furtively but clumsily slipping the coin into his pocket. &ldquo;But you
      know the kind of fellow Hod is&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered here with confusion,
      and made haste to add&mdash;&ldquo;what I mean is&mdash;he&mdash;well, he just
      wouldn&rsquo;t take no for an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went, on coldly, as if she had not heard: &ldquo;You have got <i>his</i>
      money&mdash;I saw it&mdash;there in your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tell you what, Jess,&rdquo; the father answered, with an accession of
      boldness, &ldquo;half-dollars don&rsquo;t grow on every bush up this way. I ain&rsquo;t seen
      one afore in a fortnight. And to-morrow&rsquo;s Thanksgiving, you know&mdash;and
      then you&rsquo;ve come home&mdash;and what was a fellow to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned, as if it were fruitless to say more. Then the necessity
      for relief mastered her: she faced him again, and ground the words from
      between her set teeth with scornful sadness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take <i>his</i> money&mdash;<i>and yet you knew!</i>&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II.&mdash;CONFRONTING THE ORDEAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ESSICA Lawton
      stood on the sidewalk outside the dépôt, and waited for the return of her
      father, who had gone in search of the expressman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street up and down which she glanced was in a sense familiar to her,
      for she had been born and reared on a hillside road not far away, and
      until her eighteenth year had beheld no finer or more important place than
      this Thessaly&mdash;which once had seemed so big and grand, and now,
      despite the obvious march of &ldquo;improvement,&rdquo; looked so dwarfed and
      countrified in its overlarge, misfitting coat of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself puzzled vaguely by the confusion of objects she
      remembered with things which appeared not at all to belong to the scene.
      There was the old Dearborn House, for example, on the same old corner,
      with its high piazza overhanging both streets, and its seedy brown
      clapboard sides that had needed a fresh painting as long as she could
      recollect&mdash;and had not got it yet. But beside it, where formerly had
      been a long, straggling line of decrepit sheds, was reared now a tall,
      narrow, flat-roofed brick building&mdash;the village fire-engine house;
      and through the half-open door, in which a man and a bull-dog stood
      surveying her, she could see the brassy brightness of a huge modern
      machine within. It seemed only yesterday that the manhood of Thessaly had
      rejoiced and perspired over the heavy, unwieldy wheeled pump which was
      dragged about with ropes and worked by means of long hand-brakes, with
      twelve men on a side, and a ducking from the hose for all shirkers. And
      here was a citified brick engine-house, and a &ldquo;steamer&rdquo; drawn by horses!
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere, as she looked, this incongruous jumbling of the familiar and
      the novel forced itself upon the girl&rsquo;s attention. And neither the old nor
      the new bore on its face any welcome for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a narrower and more compact street than this main thoroughfare of
      Thessaly, the people in view would have constituted almost a crowd. The
      stores all seemed to be doing a thriving business, particularly if those
      who lounged about looking in the windows might be counted upon presently
      to buy something. Both sides of the road were lined with rustic sleighs,
      drawn up wherever paths had been cut through the deep snow to the
      sidewalks; and farmers in big overcoats, comforters, and mittens were
      visible by scores, spreading buffalo-robes over their horses, or getting
      out armfuls of turkeys and tubs of butter from the straw in the bottoms of
      their sleds, or stamping with their heavy boots on the walks for warmth,
      as they discussed prices and the relative badness of the various
      snow-blocked roads in the vicinity. Farther down the street a load of hay
      had tipped over in the middle of the road, and the driver, an old man with
      a faded army-overcoat and long hair, was hurling loud imprecations at some
      boys who had snowballed him, and who now, from a safe distance, yelled
      back impolite rejoinders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all who passed, Jessica caught sight of no accustomed face. In a
      way, indeed, they were all familiar enough: they were types in feature and
      voice and dress and manner of the people among whom her whole earlier life
      had been spent. But she knew none of them&mdash;and was at once glad of
      this, and very melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had done a rash and daring thing in coming back to Dearborn County. It
      had seemed the right thing to do, and she had found the strength and
      resolution to do it. But there had been many moments of quaking
      trepidation during the long railroad journey from Tecumseh that day, and
      she was conscious now, as she looked about her, of a well-nigh complete
      collapse of courage. The tears would come, and she had more than once
      furtively to lift her handkerchief to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a face with which one, at first glance, would readily associate
      tears. The features were regularly, almost firmly cut; and the eyes&mdash;large,
      fine eyes though they were&mdash;had commonly a wide awake, steady,
      practical look, which expressed anything rather than weakness. The effect
      of the countenance, as a whole, suggested an energetic, self-contained
      young woman, who knew her way about, who was likely to be neither cheated
      nor flattered out of her rights, and who distinctly belonged to the
      managing division of the human race. This conception of her was aided by
      the erect, independent carriage of her shoulders, which made her seem
      taller than she really was, and by the clever simplicity of her black
      tailor-made jacket and dress, and her round, shapely, turban-like hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if one looked closely into this face, here in the snowlight of the
      November afternoon, there would be found sundry lines and shadows of
      sensibility and of suffering which were at war with its general
      expression. And these, when one caught them, had an air of being new, and
      of not yet having had time to lay definite hold upon the face itself. They
      were nearer it now, perhaps, as the tears came, than they had often been
      before, yet even now both they and the moisture glistening on the long
      lashes, appeared foreign to the calm immobility of the countenance. Tears
      did not seem to belong there, nor smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a real smile did all at once move to softness the compressed lines of
      her lips, and bring color to her cheeks and a pleasant mellowing of glance
      into her eyes. She had been striving to occupy her all-too-introspective
      mind by reading the signs with which the house-fronts were thickly
      covered; and here, on a doorway close beside her, was one at sight of
      which her whole face brightened. And it was a charming face now&mdash;a
      face to remember&mdash;with intelligence and fine feeling and frank
      happiness in every lineament, yet with the same curious suggestion, too,
      of the smile, like the tears, being rare and unfamiliar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sign was a small sheet of tin, painted in yellow letters on a black
      ground:=
    </p>
    <h3>
      `````REUBEN TRACY,
    </h3>
    <p>
      ````Attorney and Counsellor at Law,
    </p>
    <p>
      `````Second Floor.=
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is here, then; he has come back!&rdquo; she said aloud. She repeated,
      with an air of enjoying the sound of the words: &ldquo;He has come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked up to the sign, read it over and over again, and even touched
      it, in a meditative way, with the tip of her gloved finger. The smile came
      to her face once more as she murmured: &ldquo;<i>He</i> will know&mdash;he will
      make it easier for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even as she spoke the sad look spread over her face again. She walked
      back to the place where she had been standing, and looked resolutely away
      from the sign&mdash;at the tipped-over load of hay, at the engine-house,
      at the sleighs passing to and fro&mdash;through eyes dimmed afresh with
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she still stood when her father returned. The expressman who halted
      his bob-sleigh at the cutting in front of her, and who sat holding the
      reins while her father piled her valise and parcels on behind, looked her
      over with a half-awed, half-quizzical glance, and seemed a long time
      making up his mind to speak. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;do? Want to ride here, on the seat, longside of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an indefinable something in his tone, and in the grin that went
      with it, which she resented quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea of riding at all,&rdquo; she made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father, who had seated himself on a trunk in the centre of the sleigh,
      interposed. &ldquo;Why, Jess, you remember Steve, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked,
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expressman and the girl looked briefly at one another, and nodded in a
      perfunctory manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawton went on: &ldquo;He offered himself to give us a lift as far as the house.
      He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; that way&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you, Steve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impulse was strong in Jessica to resist&mdash;precisely why she might
      have found it difficult to explain&mdash;but apparently there was no
      choice remaining to her. &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will sit beside
      you, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped into the sleigh at this, and took her seat on the other end of
      the big trunk. The express-man gave a slap of the lines and a cluck to the
      horse, which started briskly down the wide street, the bell at its collar
      giving forth a sustained, cheery tinkle as they sped through the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think&mdash;ain&rsquo;t this better&rsquo;n walkin&rsquo;?&rdquo; remarked
      Lawton, after a time, knocking his heels in a satisfied way against the
      side of the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt as if the walk would do me good,&rdquo; she answered, simply. Her face
      was impassivity itself, as she looked straight before her, over the
      express-man&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Lawton felt oppressed by the conviction that his daughter was annoyed.
      Perhaps it was because he had insisted on riding&mdash;instead of saying
      that he would walk too, when she had disclosed her preference. He ventured
      upon an explanation, stealing wistful glances at her meantime:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Jess, Dave Rantell&rsquo;s got a turkey-shoot on to-day, down at his
      place, and I kind o&rsquo; thought I&rsquo;d try my luck with this here
      half-dollar, &rsquo;fore it gets dark. The days are shortenin&rsquo; so, this season o&rsquo;
      year, that I couldn&rsquo;t get there without Steve give me a lift. And if I
      should get a turkey&mdash;why, we&rsquo;ll have a regular Thanksgiving dinner;
      and with you come home, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this she did not trust herself to make answer, but kept her face
      rigidly set, and her eyes fixed as if engrossed in meditation. They had
      passed the great iron-works on the western outskirts of the village now,
      and the road leading to the suburb of Burfield ran for a little through
      almost open country. The keener wind raised here in resistance to the
      rapid transit of the sleigh&mdash;no doubt it was this which brought the
      deep flush to her cheeks and the glistening moisture to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They presently overtook two young men who were trudging along abreast,
      each in one of the tracks made by traffic, and who stepped aside to let
      the sleigh go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Hod!&rdquo; called out the expressman as he passed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got your
      trunks. Come back for good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Steve!... I don&rsquo;t quite know yet,&rdquo; was the reply which came back&mdash;the
      latter half of it too late for the expressman&rsquo;s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica had not seen the pedestrians until the sleigh was close upon them;
      then, in the moment&rsquo;s glimpse of them vouchsafed her, she had recognized
      young Mr. Boyce, and, in looking away from him with swift decision, had
      gazed full into the eyes of his companion. This other remembered her too,
      it was evident, even in that brief instant of passing, for a smile of
      greeting was in the glance he returned, and he lifted his hat as she swept
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Reuben Tracy, then! Despite his beard, he seemed scarcely to have
      aged in face during these last five years; but he looked straighter and
      stronger, and his bearing had more vigor and firmness than she remembered
      of him in the days when she was an irregular pupil at the little old
      Burfield-road school-house, and he was the teacher. She was glad that he
      looked so hale and healthful. And had her tell-tale face, she wondered,
      revealed as she passed him all the deep pleasure she felt at seeing him
      again&mdash;at knowing he was near? She tried to recall whether she had
      smiled, and could not make sure. But <i>he</i> had smiled&mdash;of that
      there was not a doubt; and he had known her on the instant, and had taken
      off his hat, not merely jerked his finger toward it. Ah, what delight
      there was in these thoughts!
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to her father, and lifting her voice above the jingle of the
      bell, spoke with animation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about the second man we just, passed&mdash;Mr. Tracy. Has he been
      in Thessaly long, and is he doing a good business?&rdquo; She added hastily, as
      if to forestall some possible misconception: &ldquo;He used to be my
      school-teacher, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; on all right,&rdquo; replied Lawton: &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t heard nothin&rsquo;
      to the contrary. He must a&rsquo; been back from New York along about a year&mdash;maybe
      two.&rdquo; To her great annoyance he shouted out to the driver: &ldquo;Steve, how
      long&rsquo;s Rube Tracy been back in Thessaly? You keep track o&rsquo; things better&rsquo;n
      I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expressman replied over his shoulder: &ldquo;Should say about a year come
      Christmas.&rdquo; Then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, he transferred the reins to his
      other hand, twisted himself half around on his seat, and looked into
      Jessica&rsquo;s face with his earlier and offensive expression of mingled
      familiarity and diffidence. &ldquo;He appeared to remember you: took off his
      hat,&rdquo; he said. There was an unmistakable leer on his lank countenance as
      he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That other fellow was Hod Boyce, the General&rsquo;s son, you know&mdash;just
      come back from the old country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know!&rdquo; she made answer curtly, and turned away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During what remained of the journey she preserved silence, keeping her
      gaze steadily fixed on the drifted fields beyond the fence in front of her
      and thinking about these two young men&mdash;at first with infinite
      bitterness and loathing of the one, and then, for a longer time, and with
      a soft, half-saddened pleasure, of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was passing strange that she should find herself here at all&mdash;here
      in this village which for years at a time she had sworn never to see
      again. But, when she thought of it, it seemed still more remarkable that
      at the very outset she should see, walking together, the two men whom
      memory most distinctly associated with her old life here as a girl. She
      had supposed them both&mdash;her good and her evil genius&mdash;to be far
      away; in all her inchoate specula-tions about how she should meet various
      people, no idea of encountering either of these had risen in her mind. Yet
      here they were&mdash;and walking together!
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conjunction disturbed and vaguely troubled her. She tried over and
      over again to reassure herself by saying that it was a mere accident; of
      course they had been acquainted with each other for years, and they had
      happened to meet, and what more natural than that they should walk on side
      by side? And yet it somehow seemed wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben Tracy was the best man she had ever known. Poor girl&mdash;so
      grievous had been her share of life&rsquo;s lessons that she really thought of
      him as the only good man she had ever known. In all the years of her
      girlhood&mdash;unhappy, wearied, and mutinous, with squalid misery at
      home, and no respite from it possible outside which, looked back upon at
      this distance, did not seem equally coarse and repellent&mdash;there had
      been but this solitary gleam of light, the friendship of Reuben Tracy.
      Striving now to recall the forms in which this friendship had been
      manifested, she was conscious that there was not much to remember. He had
      simply impressed her as a wise and unselfish friend&mdash;that was all.
      The example of kindness, gentleness, of patient industry which he had set
      before her in the rude, bare-walled little school-room, and which she felt
      now had made a deep and lasting impression on her, had been set for all
      the rest as well. If sometimes he had seemed to like her better than the
      other girls, his preference was of a silent, delicate, unexpressed sort&mdash;as
      if prompted solely by acquaintance with her greater need for sympathy.
      Without proffers of aid, almost without words, he had made her comprehend
      that, if evil fell upon her, the truest and most loyal help and counsel in
      all the world could be had from him for the asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil had fallen, in one massed, cruel, stunning stroke, and she had
      staggered blindly away&mdash;away anywhere, anyhow, to any fate. Almost
      her instincts had persuaded her to go to him; but he was a young man, only
      a few years her senior&mdash;and she had gone away without seeing him. But
      she had carried into the melancholy, bitter exile a strange sense of
      gratitude, if so it may be called, to Reuben Tracy for the compassionate
      aid he would have extended, had he known; and she said to herself now, in
      her heart of hearts, that it was this good feeling which had remained like
      a leaven of hope in her nature, and had made it possible for her at last,
      by its mysterious and beneficent workings, to come out into the open air
      again and turn her face toward the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had taken off his hat to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The very thought newly nerved her for the ordeal which she had proposed to
      herself&mdash;the task of bearing, here in the daily presence of those
      among whom she had been reared, the burden of a hopelessly discredited
      life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;YOUNG MR. BOYCE&rsquo;S MEDITATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he changes in
      Thessaly&rsquo;s external appearance did not particularly impress young Mr.
      Horace Boyce as he walked down the main street in the direction of his
      father&rsquo;s house. For one thing, he had been here for a fortnight only a few
      months before, upon his return from Europe, and had had pointed out to him
      all of novelty that his native village offered. And again, nearly four
      years of acquaintance with the chief capitals of the Old World had so
      dulled his vision, so to speak, that it was no longer alert to detect the
      presence of new engine-houses and brick stores in the place of earlier and
      less imposing structures. To be accurate, he did not think much about
      Thessaly, one way or the other. So long as his walk led him along the
      busier part of the thoroughfare, his attention was fully occupied by
      encounters and the exchange of greetings with old school-fellows and
      neighbors, who all seemed glad to see him home again; and when he had
      passed the last store on the street, and had of necessity exchanged the
      sidewalk for one of the two deep-beaten tracks in the centre of the
      drifted road, his thoughts were still upon a more engrossing subject than
      the growth and prosperity of any North American town.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were pleasant thoughts, though, as any one might read in a glance at
      his smooth-shaven, handsome face, with its satisfied half smile and its
      bold, confident expression of eyes. He stopped once in his rapid walk and
      stood for a minute or two in silent contemplation, just before he reached
      the open stretch of country which lay like a wedge between the two halves
      of the village. The white surface in front of him was strewn here with dry
      boughs and twigs, broken from the elms above by the weight of the recent
      snowfall. Beyond the fence some boys with comforters tied about their ears
      were skating on a pond in the fields. Mr. Boyce looked over these to the
      darkened middle-distance of the wintry picture, where rose the grimy bulk
      and tall smoke-belching chimneys of the Minster iron-works. He seemed to
      find exhilaration in his long, intent gaze at these solid evidences of
      activity and wealth, for he filled his lungs with a deep, contented
      draught of the nipping air when he finally turned and resumed his walk,
      swinging his shoulders and lightly tapping the crusted snowbanks at his
      side with his stick as he stepped briskly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minster iron-works were undoubtedly worth thinking about, and all the
      more so because they were not new. During all the dozen or more years of
      their existence they had never once been out of blast. At seasons of
      extreme depression in the market, when even Pennsylvania was idle and the
      poor smelters of St. Louis and Chicago could scarcely remember when they
      had been last employed, these chimneys upon which he had just looked had
      never ceased for a day to hurl their black clouds into the face of the
      sky. They had been built by one of the cleverest and most daring of all
      the strong men whom that section had produced&mdash;the late Stephen
      Minster. It was he who had seen in the hills close about the choicest
      combination of ores to be found in the whole North; it was he who had
      brought in the capital to erect and operate the works, who had organized
      and controlled the enterprise by which a direct road to the coal-fields
      was opened, and who, in affording employment to thousands and good
      investments to scores, had not failed to himself amass a colossal fortune.
      He had been dead now nearly three years, but the amount of his wealth,
      left in its entirety to his family, was still a matter of conjecture.
      Popular speculation upon this point had but a solitary clew with which to
      work. In a contest which arose a year before his death, over the control
      of the Northern Union Telegraph Company, he had sent down proxies
      representing a clear six hundred thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of shares. With
      this as a basis for calculation, curious people had arrived at a shrewd
      estimate of his total fortune as ranging somewhere between two and three
      millions of dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Minster had died very suddenly, and had been sincerely mourned by
      a community which owed him nothing but good-will, and could remember no
      single lapse from honesty or kindliness in his whole unostentatious,
      useful career. It was true that the absence of public-spirited bequests in
      his will created for the moment a sense of disappointment; but the
      explanation quickly set afoot&mdash;that he had not foreseen an early
      death, and had postponed to declining years, which, alas! never came, the
      task of apportioning a moiety of his millions among deserving charities&mdash;was
      plausible enough to be received everywhere. By virtue of a testament
      executed two years before&mdash;immediately after the not altogether
      edifying death of his only son&mdash;all his vast property devolved upon
      Mrs. Minster, and her two daughters, Kate and Ethel. Every unmarried man
      in Thessaly&mdash;and perhaps, with a certain vague repining, here and
      there one of the married men too&mdash;remembered all these facts each
      time he passed the home of the Minsters on the Seminary road, and looked
      over the low wall of masonry at the close-trimmed lawn, the costly
      fountain, the gravelled carriage-drive, and the great house standing back
      and aloof in stately seclusion among the trees and the rose-bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of these facts were familiar as well to Mr. Horace Boyce. As he
      strode along, filliping the snow with his cane and humming to himself, he
      mentally embellished them with certain deductions drawn from information
      gathered during the journey by rail from New York. The Miss Kate Minster
      whom he had met was the central figure in his meditations, as indeed she
      was the important personage in her family. The mother had impressed him as
      an amiable and somewhat limited woman, without much force of character;
      the younger daughter, Ethel, he remembered dimly, as a delicate and
      under-sized girl who was generally kept home from school by reason of
      ill-health, and it was evident from such remarks as the two ladies dropped
      that she was still something of an invalid. But it was clear that Miss
      Kate lacked neither moral nor bodily strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite frank with himself in thinking that, apart from all questions
      of money, she was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. It was
      an added charm that her beauty fitted so perfectly the idea of great
      wealth. She might have been the daughter of the millions themselves, so
      tall and self-contained and regal a creature was she, with the firm, dark
      face of her father reproduced in feminine grace and delicacy of outline;
      with a skin as of an Oriental queen, softly luxuriant in texture and in
      its melting of creamy and damask and deepening olive hues; and with large,
      richly brown, deep-fringed eyes which looked proudly and steadily on all
      the world, young men included. These fine orbs were her most obvious
      physical inheritance from her father. The expression &ldquo;the Minster eyes,&rdquo;
       would convey as distinct an impression to the brain of the average
      Thessalian as if one had said &ldquo;the Minster iron-works.&rdquo; The great founder
      of the millions, Stephen Minster, had had them, and they were the notable
      feature of even his impressive face. The son who was dead, Stephen junior,
      had also had them, as Horace now recalled to mind; but set in his weak
      head they had seemed to lose significance, and had been, in truth, very
      generally in his latter years dimmed and opacated by the effects of
      dissipation. The pale, sweet-faced little Ethel Minster, as he remembered
      her, had them as well, although with her they were almost hazel in color,
      and produced a timid, mournful effect. But to no other face in the entire
      family gallery did they seem to so wholly belong of right as to the
      countenance of Miss Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Boyce&rsquo;s thoughts wandered easily from the image of the heiress
      to the less tangible question of her disposition, and, more particularly,
      of her attitude toward him. There were obscurities here over which a less
      sanguine young man might have bitten his lips. He had ventured upon
      recalling himself to mother and daughter very soon after the train left
      New York, and they had not shown any shadow of annoyance when he took a
      vacant chair opposite them and began a conversation which lasted, such as
      it was, through all the long journey. But now that he came to think of it,
      his share in that conversation had been not only the proverbial lion&rsquo;s,
      but more nearly that of a whole zoological garden. Mrs. Minster had not
      affected any especial reserve; it was probable that she was by nature a
      listener rather than a talker, for she had asked him numerous questions
      about himself and about Europe. As for Miss Minster, he could scarcely
      recall anything she had said, what time she was looking at him instead of
      at her book. And he had not always been strictly comfortable under this
      look. There had been nothing unfriendly in it, it was true, nor could it
      occur to anybody to suspect in it a lack of comprehension or of interest.
      In fact, he said to himself, it was eloquent with both. The trouble was,
      as he uneasily attempted to define it, that she seemed to comprehend too
      much. Still, after all, he had said nothing to which she could take the
      faintest exception, and, if she was the intelligent woman he took her to
      be, there must have been a good deal in his talk to entertain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even a less felicitous phrase-maker than Horace Boyce could have
      manufactured pleasant small-talk out of such experiences as his had been.
      The only son of a well-to-do and important man in Thessaly, he had had the
      further advantage of inheriting some twenty thousand dollars upon
      attaining his majority, and after finishing his course at college had
      betaken himself to Europe to pursue more recondite studies there, both in
      and out of his chosen profession of the law. The fact that he had devoted
      most of his attention to the gleaning of knowledge lying beyond the
      technical pale of the law did not detract from the interesting quality of
      his observations. Besides listening to lectures at Heidelberg, he had
      listened to the orchestra swaying in unison under the baton of Strauss at
      Vienna, and to a good many other things in Pesth and Paris and Brussels
      and London, a large number of which could with propriety be described in
      polite conversation. And he flattered himself that he had discoursed upon
      these things rather cleverly, skirting delicate points with neatness, and
      bringing in effective little descriptions and humorous characterizations
      in quite a natural way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, he said to himself, it had been his privilege to see America in
      perspective&mdash;to stand upon a distant eminence, as it were, and look
      the whole country over, by and large, at a glance. This had enabled him on
      his return to discover the whimsical aspect of a good many things which
      the stay-at-home natives took with all seriousness. He had indicated some
      of these to the two ladies with a light and amiably bantering touch, and
      with a consciousness that he was opening up novel ground to both his
      hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still&mdash;he wondered if Miss Minster had really liked it. Could it be
      possible that she belonged to that thin-skinned class of Americans who
      cannot brook any comment upon anything in or of their country that is not
      wholly eulogistic&mdash;who resent even the most harmless and obvious
      pleasantry pointed at a cis-Atlantic institution? He decided this promptly
      in the negative. He had met such people, but he could not associate them
      in his mind with the idea of great wealth. And Miss Minster was rich&mdash;incredibly
      rich. No doubt she was thinking, even while she listened to him, of the
      time when she too should go to Europe, and dazzle its golden youth with
      her beauty and her millions. Now that he thought of it, he had seen much
      that same look before on the face of an American heiress, on her return
      from a London &ldquo;five-o&rsquo;clock tea,&rdquo; at which she had met an eligible
      marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be that her thoughts ran, instead, upon an eligible somebody
      nearer home? He devoted himself at this to canvassing the chances of her
      fancy being already fixed. It was of little importance that nothing in
      their conversation suggested this, because it was a subject to which they
      naturally would not have alluded. Yet he recalled that Mrs. Minster had
      spoken of their great seclusion more than once. He had gathered, moreover,
      that they knew very few people in New York City, and that they had little
      acquaintance with the section of its population which is colloquially
      known as &ldquo;society.&rdquo; This looked mightily like a clear field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Boyce stopped to thrust his cane under a twisted branch which
      lay on the snow, and toss it high over the fence, when he reached this
      stage of his meditations. His squared, erect shoulders took on a more
      buoyant swing than ever as he resumed his walk. A clear field, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now as to the problem of proceeding to occupy that field. Where was
      there a gap in the wall? Millions were not to be approached and gained by
      simple and primitive methods, as one knocks apples off an overhanging
      bough with a fence-rail. Strategy and finesse of the first order were
      required. Without doubt there was an elaborate system of defences reared
      around this girl of girls. Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s reference to seclusion might
      have itself been a warning that they lived inside a fort, and were as
      ready to train a gun on him as on anybody else. Battlements of this sort
      had been stormed time and time again, no doubt; human history was full of
      such instances. But Mr. Boyce&rsquo;s tastes were not for violent or desperate
      adventures. To go over a parapet with one&rsquo;s sword in one&rsquo;s teeth, in
      deadly peril and tempestuous triumph, might suit his father the General:
      for his own part, it seemed more sagacious and indubitably safer to tunnel
      under the works, and emerge on the inside at the proper psychological
      moment to be welcomed as a friend and adviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adviser! Who was their lawyer? The young man cast up in his mind the list
      of Thessaly&rsquo;s legal practitioners, as far as he could remember them. It
      seemed most probable that Benoni Clarke, the ex-district-attorney, would
      have the Minster business, if for no other reason than that he needed it
      less than the rest did. But Mr. Clarke was getting old, and was in feeble
      health as well. Perhaps he would be glad to have a young, active, and able
      partner, who had had the advantage of European study. Or it might be&mdash;who
      could tell?&mdash;that the young man with the European education could go
      in on his own account, and by sheer weight of cleverness, energy, and
      superior social address win over the Minster business. What unlimited
      opportunities such a post would afford him! Not only would he be the only
      young man in Thessaly who had been outside of his own country, the best
      talker, the best-informed man, the best-mannered man of the place&mdash;but
      he would be able to exhibit all these excellences from the favored
      vantage-ground of an intimate, confidential relation. The very thought was
      intoxicating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Horace Boyce was so pre-occupied with these pleasing meditations that
      he overtook a man walking in the other track, and had nearly passed him,
      before something familiar in the figure arrested his attention. He turned,
      and recognized an old schoolmate whom he had not seen for years, and had
      not expected to find in Thessaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Reuben Tracy, as I live!&rdquo; he exclaimed, cordially. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re
      back again, eh? On a visit to your folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other shook hands with him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he made answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had an office
      here for nearly a year. You are looking well. I&rsquo;m glad to see you again.
      Have you come back for good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s all settled,&rdquo; replied Mr. Horace, without a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;REUBEN TRACY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he two young men
      walked along together, separated by the ridge of snow between the tracks.
      They had never been more than friendly acquaintances, and they talked now
      of indifferent topics&mdash;of the grim climatic freak which had turned
      late November into mid-winter, of the results of the recent elections, and
      then of English weather and politics as contrasted with ours. It was a
      desultory enough conversation, for each had been absorbed in his own mind
      by thoughts a thousand leagues away from snowfalls and partisan strife,
      and the transition back to amiable commonplaces was not easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music of a sleigh-bell, which for some time had been increasing in
      volume behind them, swelled suddenly into a shrill-voiced warning close at
      their backs, and they stepped aside into the snow to let the conveyance
      pass. It was then that the express-man called out his cheery greeting, and
      that Reuben lifted his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sleigh grew small in the near distance, Reuben turned to his
      companion. &ldquo;I notice that you told him you weren&rsquo;t quite sure about
      staying here for good,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Perhaps I was mistaken&mdash;I
      understood you to say a few minutes ago that it was all settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace was not to be embarrassed by so slight a discrepancy as this&mdash;although
      for the instant the reappearance of Jessica had sent his wits tripping&mdash;and
      he was ready with a glib explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I meant was that I am quite settled in my desire to stay here. But
      of course there is just a chance that there may be no opening, and I don&rsquo;t
      want to prematurely advertise what may turn out a failure. By the way,
      wasn&rsquo;t that that Lawton girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Ben Lawton&rsquo;s oldest daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben&rsquo;s tone had a slow preciseness in it which caused Horace to glance
      closely at him, and wonder if it were possible that it masked some
      ulterior meaning. Then he reflected that Reuben had always taken serious
      views of things, and talked in that grave, measured way, and that this was
      probably a mere mannerism. So he continued, with a careless voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her in years&mdash;should scarcely have known her. Isn&rsquo;t
      it a little queer, her coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben Tracy was a big man, with heavy shoulders, a large, impassive
      countenance, and an air which to the stranger suggested lethargy. It was
      his turn to look at Horace now, and he did so with a deliberate, steady
      gaze, to which the wide space between his eyes and the total absence of
      lines at the meeting of his brows lent almost the effect of a stare. When
      he had finished this inspection of his companion&rsquo;s face, he asked simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, I have only heard it from others&mdash;but there seems
      to be no question about it&mdash;that she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she has been a sadly unfortunate and wretched girl,&rdquo; interposed
      Reuben, finishing the sentence over which the other hesitated. &ldquo;No, you
      are right. There <i>is</i> no question about that&mdash;no question
      whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is why I spoke as I did&mdash;why I am surprised at seeing her
      here again. Weren&rsquo;t you yourself surprised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I knew that she was coming. I have a letter telling me the train she
      would arrive by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two walked on in silence for a minute or two. Then Horace said, with a
      fine assumption of good feeling and honest regret:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke thoughtlessly, old fellow; of course I couldn&rsquo;t know that you
      were interested in&mdash;in the matter. I truly hope I didn&rsquo;t say anything
      to wound your feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Reuben. &ldquo;How should you? What you said is what
      everybody will say&mdash;must say. Besides, my feelings are of no interest
      whatever, so far as this affair is concerned. It is her feelings that I am
      thinking of; and the more I think&mdash;well, the truth is, I am
      completely puzzled. I have never in all my experience been so wholly at
      sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manifestly Horace could do nothing at this juncture but look his sympathy.
      To ask any question might have been to learn nothing. But his curiosity
      was so great that he almost breathed a sigh of relief when Reuben spoke
      again, even though the query he put had its disconcerting side:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you never knew much about her before she left Thessaly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew her by sight, of course, just as a village boy knows everybody. I
      take it you did know her. I can remember that she was a pretty girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If there was an underlying hint in this conjunction of sentences, it
      missed Reuben&rsquo;s perception utterly. He replied in a grave tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was in my school, up at the Burfield. And if you had asked me in
      those days to name the best-hearted girl, the brightest girl, the one who
      in all the classes had the making of the best woman in her, I don&rsquo;t doubt
      that I should have pointed to her. That is what makes the thing so
      inexpressibly sad to me now; and, what is more, I can&rsquo;t in the least see
      my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your way to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to helping her, of course. She has undertaken something that
      frightens me when I think of it. This is the point: She has made up her
      mind to come back here, earn her own living decently, face the past out
      and live it down here among those who know that past best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a resolution that will last about three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think she is determined enough. But I fear that she cruelly
      underestimates the difficulties of her task. To me it looks hopeless, and
      I&rsquo;ve thought it over pretty steadily the last few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon my asking you,&rdquo; said Horace, &ldquo;but you have confided thus far in me&mdash;what
      the deuce have you got to do with either her success or her failure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you that I was her teacher,&rdquo; answered Reuben, still with the
      slow, grave voice. &ldquo;That in itself would give me an interest in her. But
      there has been a definite claim made on me in her behalf. You remember
      Seth Fairchild, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly. He edits a paper down in Tecumseh, doesn&rsquo;t he? He did, I know,
      when I went abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, his wife&mdash;who was his cousin, Annie Fairchild, and who
      took the Burfield school after I left it to study law&mdash;she happens to
      be an angel. She is the sort of woman who, when you know her, enables you
      to understand all the exalted and sublime things that have ever been
      written about her sex. Well, a year or so after she married Seth and went
      to live in Tecumseh, she came to hear about poor Jessica Lawton, and her
      woman&rsquo;s heart prompted her to hunt the girl up and give her a chance for
      her life. I don&rsquo;t know much about what followed&mdash;this all happened a
      good many months ago&mdash;but I get a letter now from Seth, telling me
      that the girl is resolved to come home, and that his wife wants me to do
      all I can to help her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I call letting a friend in for a particularly nice
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t misunderstand me,&rdquo; said Reuben; &ldquo;I shall be only too glad if I
      can serve the poor girl. But how to do it&mdash;that&rsquo;s what troubles me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her project is a crazy one, to begin with. I wonder that sane people like
      the Fairchilds should have encouraged it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they did. My impression is that they regarded it as unwise
      and tried to dissuade her from it. Seth doesn&rsquo;t write as if he thought she
      would succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t say there was much danger of it. She will be back again
      in Tecumseh before Christmas.&rdquo; After a pause Horace added, in a
      confidential way: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of my business, old fellow; but if I were you
      I&rsquo;d be careful how I acted in this matter. You can&rsquo;t afford to be mixed up
      with her in the eyes of the people here. Of course your motives are
      admirable, but you know what an overgrown village is for gossip. You won&rsquo;t
      be credited with good intentions or any disinterestedness, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to be a new view of the situation to Reuben. He made no
      immediate answer, but walked along with his gaze bent on the track before
      him and his hands behind his back. At last he said, with an air of
      speaking to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if one does mean well and is perfectly clear about it in his own
      mind, how far ought he to allow his course to be altered by the possible
      misconceptions of others? That opens up a big question, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have said that you were not clear about it&mdash;that you were
      all at sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to means, yes; but not as to motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody but you will make the distinction. And you have your practice to
      consider&mdash;the confidence of your clients. Fancy the effect it will
      have on them&mdash;your turning up as the chief friend and patron of a&mdash;of
      the Lawton girl! You can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo; Reuben looked at his companion
      again with the same calm, impassive gaze. Then he said slowly: &ldquo;I can see
      how the matter presents itself to you. I had thought first of going to the
      dépôt to meet her; but, on consideration, it seemed better to wait and
      have a talk with her after she had seen her family. I am going out to
      their place now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which this announcement was made served to change the topic of
      conversation. The talk became general again, and Horace turned it upon the
      subject of the number of lawyers in town, their relative prosperity and
      value, and the local condition of legal business. He found that he was
      right in guessing that Mr. Clarke enjoyed Thessaly&rsquo;s share of the business
      arising from the Minster ironworks, and that this share was more important
      than formerly, when all important affairs were in the hands of a New York
      firm. He was interested, too, in what Reuben Tracy revealed about his own
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have nothing to complain of,&rdquo; Reuben said, in response to a
      question. &ldquo;It is a good thing to be kept steadily at work&mdash;good for a
      man&rsquo;s mind as well as for his pocket. Latterly I have had almost too much
      to attend to, since the railroad business on this division was put in my
      charge; and I grumble to myself sometimes over getting so little spare
      time for reading and for other things I should like to attempt. I suppose
      a good many of the young lawyers here would call that an ungrateful frame
      of mind. Some of them have a pretty hard time of it, I am afraid.
      Occasionally I can put some work in their way; but it isn&rsquo;t easy, because
      clients seem to resent having their business handled by unsuccessful men.
      That would be an interesting thing to trace, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;the law of
      the human mind which prompts people to boost a man as soon as he has shown
      that he can climb without help, and to pull down those who could climb
      well enough with a little assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think there isn&rsquo;t much chance for still another young lawyer to
      enter the field here?&rdquo; queried Horace, bringing the discussion back to
      concrete matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; replied Reuben. &ldquo;There is no earthly reason
      why you shouldn&rsquo;t try. There are too many lawyers here, it is true, but
      then I suppose there are too many lawyers everywhere&mdash;except heaven.
      A certain limited proportion of them always prosper&mdash;the rest don&rsquo;t.
      It depends upon yourself which class you will be in. Go ahead, and if I
      can help you in any way I shall be very glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind, I&rsquo;m sure. But, you know, it won&rsquo;t be as if I came a stranger
      to the place,&rdquo; said Horace. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s social connections will help me a
      good deal&rdquo;&mdash;Horace thought he noted a certain incredulous gesture by
      his companion here, and wondered at it, but went on&mdash;&ldquo;and then my
      having studied in Europe ought to count. I have another advantage, too, in
      being on very friendly terms with Mrs. and Miss Minster. I rode up with
      them from New York to-day, and we had a long talk. I don&rsquo;t want anything
      said about it yet, but it looks mightily as if I were to get the whole law
      business of the ironworks and of their property in general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Boyce did not wince or change color under the meditative gaze
      with which Reuben regarded him upon hearing this; but he was conscious of
      discomfort, and he said to himself that his companion&rsquo;s way of staring
      like an introspective ox at people was unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a tremendous start for you,&rdquo; remarked Reuben at last. &ldquo;I
      hope you won&rsquo;t be disappointed in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a tolerably safe prospect,&rdquo; answered Horace, lightly. &ldquo;You say
      that you&rsquo;re overworked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite that, but I don&rsquo;t get as much time as I should like for outside
      matters. I want to go on the school board here, for example&mdash;I see
      ever so many features of the system which seem to me to be flaws, and
      which I should like to help remedy&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t spare the time. And
      then there is the condition of the poor people in the quarter grown up
      around the iron-works and the factories, and the lack of a good library,
      and the saloon question, and the way in which the young men and boys of
      the village spend their evenings, and so on. These are the things I am
      really interested in; and instead of them I have to devote all my energies
      to deeds and mortgages and specifications for trestle-works. That&rsquo;s what I
      meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take in a partner? That would relieve you of a good deal of
      the routine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;ve thought of that more than once lately. I daresay that
      if the right sort of a young man had been at hand, the idea would have
      attracted me long ago. But, to tell the truth, there isn&rsquo;t anybody in
      Thessaly who meets precisely my idea of a partner&mdash;whom I quite feel
      like taking into my office family, so to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I may want to talk with you again on this point,&rdquo; said Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Reuben made no reply, and the two walked on for a few moments in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were approaching a big, ungainly, shabby-looking structure, which
      presented a receding roof, a row of windows with small, old-fashioned
      panes of glass, and a broad, rickety veranda sprawling the whole width of
      its front, to the highway on their left. This had once been a rural
      wayside tavern, but now, by the encircling growth of the village, it had
      taken on a hybrid character, and managed to combine in a very complete way
      the coarse demerits of a town saloon with the evil license of a suburban
      dive. Its location rendered it independent of most of the restrictions
      which the village authorities were able to enforce in Thessaly itself, and
      this freedom from restraint attracted the dissipated imagination of town
      and country alike. It was Dave Rantell&rsquo;s place, and being known far and
      wide as the most objectionable resort in Dearborn County, was in reality
      much worse than its reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open sheds at the side of the tavern were filled with horses and
      sleighs, and others were ranged along at the several posts by the roadside
      in front&mdash;these latter including some smart city cutters, and even a
      landau on runners. From the farther side of the house came, at brief
      intervals, the sharp report of rifle-shots, rising loud above the
      indistinct murmuring of a crowd&rsquo;s conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a turkey-shoot,&rdquo; said Reuben. &ldquo;This man Rantell has them every
      year at Thanksgiving and Christmas,&rdquo; he added, as they came in view of the
      scene beyond the tavern. &ldquo;There! Have you seen anything in Europe like
      that?&rdquo; Let it be stated without delay that there was no trace of patriotic
      pride in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wide gate of the tavern yard was open, and the path through it had
      been trampled smooth by many feet. In the yard just beyond were clustered
      some forty or fifty men, standing about in the snow, and with their backs
      to the road. Away in the distance, and to the right, were visible two or
      three slouching figures of men. Traversing laterally and leftward the
      broad, unbroken field of snow, the eye caught a small, dark object on the
      great white sheet; if the vision was clear and far-sighted, a closer study
      would reveal this to be a bird standing alone in the waste of whiteness,
      tied by the leg to a stake near by, and waiting to be shot at. The
      attention of every man in the throng was riveted on this remote and
      solitary fowl. There was a deep hush for a fraction of a second after each
      shot. Then the turkey either hopped to one side, which meant that the
      bullet had gone whistling past, or sank to the ground after a brief wild
      fluttering of wings. In the former case, another loaded rifle was handed
      out, and suspense began again; in the latter event, there ensued a short
      intermission devoted to beverages and badinage, the while a boy started
      across the fields toward the throng with the dead turkey, and the distant
      slouching figures busied themselves in tying up a new feathered target.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t what you would call elevating, is it?&rdquo; said Horace, as the
      two stood looking over the fence upon the crowd. &ldquo;Still, it has its
      interest as a national product. I&rsquo;ve seen dog-fights and cock-mains in
      England attended by whole thousands of men, that were ever so much worse
      than this. If you think of it, this isn&rsquo;t particularly brutal, as such
      sports go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what puzzles me is that men should like such sports at all,&rdquo; said
      Reuben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; replied Horace, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re better off in that respect than the
      English are. The massacre of rats in a pit is a thing that you can get an
      assemblage of nobility, and even royalty, for, over there. Now, that isn&rsquo;t
      even relatively true here. Take this turkey-shoot of Rantell&rsquo;s, for
      example. You won&rsquo;t find any gentlemen here; that is, anybody who sets up
      to be a gentleman in either the English or the American sense of the
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in ironical answer, a sharp, strident voice rose above the vague
      babble of the throng inside the yard, and its accents reached the two
      young men with painful distinctness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet five dollars that General Boyce kills his six birds in ten shots&mdash;bad
      cartridges barred!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;THE TURKEY-SHOOT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he compassionate
      Reuben was quick to feel the humiliation with which this brawling
      announcement of the General&rsquo;s presence must cover the General&rsquo;s son. It
      had been apparent to him before that Horace would have to considerably
      revise the boyish estimate of his father&rsquo;s position and importance which,
      he brought back with him from Europe. But it was cruel to have the work of
      disillusion begun in this rude, blunt form. He tried to soften the effect
      of the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as bad as all that,&rdquo; he said, tacitly ignoring what they had
      just heard. &ldquo;No doubt some rough people do come to these gatherings; but,
      on the other hand, if a man is fond of shooting, why, don&rsquo;t you see, this
      furnishes him with the best kind of test of his skill. Really, there is no
      reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t come&mdash;and&mdash;besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben was not clever at saying things he did not wholly mean, and his
      good-natured attempt to gloss over the facts came to an abrupt halt from
      sheer lack of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall have to learn to be a Thessalian all over again,&rdquo; said
      Horace. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, well go in. It&rsquo;s just as well to see the
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suiting the action to the word, he moved toward the gate. Reuben hesitated
      for a moment, and then, with an &ldquo;All right&mdash;for a few minutes&rdquo;&mdash;followed
      him into the yard. The two young men stood upon the outskirts of the crowd
      for a time, and then, as opportunity favored, edged their way through
      until they were a part of the inner half-ring around a table, upon which
      were rifles, cartridges, cleaning rags, a bottle and some tumblers. At
      their feet, under and about the table, lay several piles of turkeys. The
      largest of these heaps, containing some dozen birds, was, as they were
      furtively informed by a small boy, the property of the &ldquo;General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman, who stood well to the front of the table, might be
      pardoned for not turning around to note the presence of new-comers, since
      he himself had some money wagered on his work. He had on the instant fired
      his third shot, and stood with the smoking gun lowered, and his eyes fixed
      on the target in concentrated expectancy. The turkey made a movement and
      somebody called out &ldquo;hit!&rdquo; But the General&rsquo;s keen vision told him better.
      &ldquo;No, it was a line shot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a foot too high.&rdquo; He kept his gaze
      still fixed on the remote object, mechanically taking the fresh gun which
      was handed to him, but not immediately raising it to his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Sylvanus&mdash;familiarly called &ldquo;Vane&rdquo;&mdash;Boyce was now close
      upon sixty, of middle height and a thick and portly figure, and with
      perfectly white, close-cropped hair and mustache. His face had in its day
      boasted both regular, well-cut features and a clear complexion. But the
      skin was now of one uniform florid tint, even to the back of his neck, and
      the outlines of the profile were blurred and fattened. His gray eyes, as
      they swept the field of snow, had still their old, sharp, commanding
      glance, but they looked out from red and puffy lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he lifted his gun, an interested bystander professed to discover
      Horace for the first time, and called out exuberantly: &ldquo;Why, hello, Hod! I
      say, &lsquo;Vane, here&rsquo;s your boy Hod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here, fair play!&rdquo; shouted some of the General&rsquo;s backers; &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
      try that on&mdash;spoiling his aim in that way.&rdquo; Their solicitude was
      uncalled for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn my boy Hod, and you too!&rdquo; remarked the General calmly, raising his
      rifle with an uninterrupted movement, levelling it with deliberation,
      firing, and killing his bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the hum of conversation which arose at this, the General turned, laid
      his gun down, and stepped across the space to where Horace and Reuben
      stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lad,&rdquo; he said heartily, shaking his son&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see
      you back. I&rsquo;d have been at the dépôt to meet you, only I had this match on
      with Blodgett, and the money was up. I hope you didn&rsquo;t mind my damning you
      just now&mdash;I daresay I haven&rsquo;t enough influence to have it do you much
      harm&mdash;and it was Grigg&rsquo;s scheme to rattle my nerve just as I was
      going to shoot. How are you, anyway? How de do, Tracy? What&rsquo;ll you both
      drink? This is rye whiskey here, but they&rsquo;ll bring out anything else you
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a mouthful of this,&rdquo; said Horace; &ldquo;hold on, not so much.&rdquo; He
      poured back some of the generous portion which had been given him, and
      touched glasses with his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you won&rsquo;t have anything, Tracy?&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;No? You
      don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good for you. Standing around in the cold here, a man
      needs something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to stand around in the cold,&rdquo; answered Reuben with a
      half-smile. &ldquo;I must be going on in a moment or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; said the General, cheerily, as he put down his glass and
      took up the gun. &ldquo;Wait and see me shoot my score. I&rsquo;ve got the range now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to kill every bird but one, now, General,&rdquo; said one of his
      friends, in admonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; replied the champion, in a confident tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it turned out not to be all right. The seventh shot was a miss, and so
      was the tenth, upon which, as the final and conclusive one, great interest
      hung. Some of those who had lost money by reason of their faith in the
      General seemed to take it to heart, but the General himself displayed no
      sign of gloom. He took another drink, and then emptied his pockets of all
      the bank-bills they contained, and distributed them among his creditors
      with perfect amiability. There was not enough money to go around,
      evidently, for he called out in a pleasant voice to his son:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here a minute, Hod. Have you got thirty dollars loose in your
      pocket? I&rsquo;m that much short.&rdquo; He pushed about the heap of limp turkeys on
      the snow under the table with one foot, in amused contemplation, and
      added: &ldquo;These skinny wretches have cost us about nine dollars apiece. You
      might at least have fed &rsquo;em a trifle better, Dave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace produced the sum mentioned and handed it over to his father with a
      somewhat subdued, not to say rueful, air. He did not quite like the way in
      which the little word &ldquo;us&rdquo; had been used.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the General was light-heartedly engaged in apportioning out his
      son&rsquo;s money, and settling his bill, a new man came up, and, taking a rifle
      in his hands, inquired the price of a shot. He was told that it was ten
      cents, and to this information was added with cold emphasis the remark
      that before he fooled with the guns he must put down his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got the coin fast enough,&rdquo; said the newcomer, ringing four dimes
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said Horace to his father and Reuben, who were about to
      quit the yard. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s watch Ben Lawton shoot. I might as well see the last
      of my half-dollar. He&rsquo;s had one drink out of it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lawton lifted the gun as if he were accustomed to firearms, and after he
      had made sure of his footing on the hard-trodden snow, took a long,
      careful aim, and fired. It was with evident sorrow that he saw the snow
      fly a few feet to one side of the turkey. He decided to have only two
      shots more, and one drink, and the drink first&mdash;a drink of such full
      and notable dimensions that Dave Rantell was half-tempted to intervene
      between the cup and the lip. The two shots which followed were very good
      shots indeed&mdash;one of them even seemed to have cut some feathers into
      the air&mdash;but they killed no turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ben looked for a long time after his last bullet, as if in some vague
      hope that it might have paused on the way, and would resume its fatal
      course in due season. Then he laid the rifle down with a deep sigh, and
      walked slowly out, with his hands plunged dejectedly into his trousers
      pockets, and his shoulders more rounded than ever. The habitual expression
      of helpless melancholy which his meagre, characterless visage wore was
      deepened now to despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ben,&rdquo; said Horace to him, as he shuffled past them, &ldquo;you were
      right. You might just as well have hung around the dépôt, and let some one
      else carry my things. You&rsquo;ve got no more to show for it now than if you
      had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man spoke in the tone of easy, paternal banter which prosperous
      people find it natural to adopt toward their avowedly weak and foolish
      brethren, and it did not occur to Lawton to resent it. He stopped, and
      lifted his head just high enough to look in a gloomy way at Horace and his
      companions for a moment; then he dropped it again and turned to resume his
      course without answering. On second thought he halted, and without again
      looking up, groaned out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t another such a darned worthless fool as I be in the whole
      darned county. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll say to her. I&rsquo;m a good mind not to
      go home at all. Here I was, figurin&rsquo; on havin&rsquo; a real Thanksgiving dinner
      for her, to try and make her feel glad she&rsquo;d come back amongst us again;
      and if I&rsquo;d saved my money and fired all five shots, I&rsquo;d a got a bird, sure&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s what makes me so blamed mad. It&rsquo;s always my darned luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke a boy came up to them, dragging a hand-sled upon which
      General Boyce&rsquo;s costly collection of poultry was piled. Horace stopped the
      lad, and took from the top of the heap two of the best of the fowls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Ben,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take these home with you. We&rsquo;ve got more than we
      know what to do with. We should only give them away to people who didn&rsquo;t
      need them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lawton had been moved almost to tears by the force of his
      self-depreciatory emotions. His face brightened now on the instant, as he
      grasped the legs of the turkeys and felt their weight. He looked
      satisfiedly down at their ruffling circumference of blue-black feathers,
      and at their pimply pink heads dragging sidewise on the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular brick, Hod,&rdquo; he said, with more animation than it was
      his wont to display. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be tickled to death down to the house. I&rsquo;m
      obliged to you, and so she&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, weighed the birds again in his hand with a saddened air,
      and held them out toward Horace. All the joy had gone out of his
      countenance and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, Hod, but I can&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said,
      with pathetic reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; replied the young man, curtly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself
      twice in the same afternoon. Of course you&rsquo;ll take them. Only go straight
      home with them, instead of selling them for drinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace turned upon his heel as he spoke and rejoined his father and
      Reuben, who had walked on slowly ahead. The General had been telling his
      companion some funny story, and his eyes were still twinkling with
      merriment as his son came up, and he repeated to him the gist of his
      humorous narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace did not seem to appreciate the joke, and kept a serious face even
      at the most comical part of the anecdote. This haunting recurrence of the
      Lawton business, as he termed it in his thoughts, annoyed him; and still
      more was he disturbed and vexed by what he had seen of his father. During
      his previous visit to Thessaly upon his return from Europe, some months
      before, the General had been leading a temperate and almost monastic life
      under the combined restraints of rheumatism and hay-fever, and this
      present revelation of his tastes and habits came therefore in the nature
      of a surprise to Horace. The latter was unable to find any elements of
      pleasure in this surprise, and scowled at the snow accordingly, instead of
      joining in his father&rsquo;s laughter. Besides, the story was not altogether of
      the kind which sits with most dignity on paternal lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General noted his son&rsquo;s solemnity and deferred to it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you
      gave that poor devil the turkeys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;re as poor as
      they make &rsquo;em. Only&mdash;what do you think, Tracy; as long as I&rsquo;d
      shot all the birds, I might have been consulted, eh, about giving them
      away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The query was put in a jocular enough tone, but it grated upon the young
      man&rsquo;s mood. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the turkey business is one that either of us
      particularly shines in,&rdquo; he replied, with a snap in his tone. &ldquo;You say
      that your turkeys cost you nine dollars apiece. Apparently I am by way of
      paying fifteen dollars each for my two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;By way of&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s an English expression, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; put in Reuben,
      hastily, to avert the threatened domestic dispute. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it in
      novels, but I never heard it used before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The talk was fortunately turned at this from poultry to philology; and the
      General, though he took no part in the conversation, evinced no desire to
      return to the less pleasant subject. Thus the three walked on to the
      corner where their ways separated. As they stood here for the parting
      moment, Reuben said in an aside to Horace:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a kindly act of yours&mdash;to give Lawton the turkeys. I can&rsquo;t
      tell you how much it pleased me. Those little things show the character of
      a man. If you like to come down to my office Friday, and are still of the
      same mind about a partnership, we will talk it over.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;THANKSGIVING AT THE MINSTERS&rsquo;.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> REMEMBER having
      years ago been introduced to one of America&rsquo;s richest men, as he sat on
      the broad veranda of a Saratoga hotel in the full glare of the morning
      sunlight. It is evident that at such a solemn moment I should have been
      filled with valuable and impressive reflections; yet, such is the
      perversity and wrong-headedness of the human mind, I could for the life of
      me evolve no weightier thought than this: &ldquo;Here is a man who can dispose
      of hundreds of millions of dollars by a nod of the head, yet cannot with
      all this countless wealth command a dye for his whiskers which will not
      turn violet in the sunshine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sleek and sober-visaged butler who moved noiselessly about the
      dining-room of the Minster household may have had some such passing vision
      of the vanity of riches, as he served what was styled a Thanksgiving
      dinner. Vast as the fortune was, it could not surround that board with
      grateful or lighthearted people upon even this selected festal day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room itself must have dampened any but the most indomitably cheerful
      spirits. It had a sombre and formal aspect, to which the tall oleanders
      and dwarf palms looking through the glass on the conservatory side lent
      only an added sense of coldness. The furniture was of dark oak and even
      darker leather; the walls were panelled in two shades of the same serious
      tint; the massive, carved sideboard and the ponderous mantel declined to
      be lifted out of their severe dignity by such trivial accessories as
      silver and rare china and vases of flowers. There were pictures in plenty,
      and costly lace curtains inside the heavy outer hangings at the windows,
      and pretty examples of embroidery here and there which would have
      brightened any less resolutely grave environment: in this room they went
      for nothing, or next to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four women sat at this Thanksgiving dinner, and each, being in her own
      heart conscious of distinct weariness, politely took it for granted that
      the others were enjoying their meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk languished, or fitfully flared up around some strictly uninteresting
      subject with artificial fervor the while the butler was in the room. His
      presence in the house was in the nature of an experiment, and Mrs. Minster
      from time to time eyed him in a furtive way, and then swiftly turned her
      glance aside on the discovery that he was eying her. Probably he was as
      good as other butlers, she reflected; he was undoubtedly English, and he
      had come to her well recommended by a friend in New York. But she was
      unaccustomed to having a man servant in the dining-room, and it jarred
      upon her to call him by his surname, which was Cozzens, instead of by the
      more familiar Daniel or Patrick as she did the gardener and the coachman.
      Before he came&mdash;a fortnight or so ago&mdash;she had vaguely thought
      of him as in livery; but the idea of seeing him in anything but what she
      called a &ldquo;dress suit,&rdquo; and he termed &ldquo;evening clothes,&rdquo; had been
      definitely abandoned. What she chiefly wished about him now was that he
      would not look at her all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster, being occupied in this way, contributed very little to what
      conversation there was during the dinner. It was not her wont to talk much
      at any time. She was perhaps a trifle below the medium height of her sex,
      full-figured rather than stout, and with a dark, capable, and altogether
      singular face, in which the most marked features were a proud, thin-lipped
      mouth, which in repose closed tight and drew downward at the corners;
      small black eyes, that had an air of seeing very cleverly through things;
      and a striking arrangement of her prematurely white hair, which was
      brushed straight from the forehead over a high roll. From a more or less
      careful inspection of this face, even astute people were in the habit of
      concluding that Mrs. Minster was a clever and haughty woman. In truth, she
      was neither. Her reserve was due in part to timidity, in part to lack of
      interest in the matters which seemed to concern those with whom she was
      most thrown into contact outside her own house. Her natural disposition
      had been the reverse of unkindly, but it included an element of suspicion,
      which the short and painful career of her son, and the burden of
      responsibility for a great estate, had tended unduly to develop. She did
      not like many of the residents of Thessaly, yet it had never occurred to
      her to live elsewhere. If the idea had dawned in her mind, she would
      undoubtedly have picked out as an alternative her native village on the
      Hudson, where her Dutch ancestors had lived from early colonial times. The
      life of a big city had never become even intelligible to her, much less
      attractive. She went to the Episcopal church regularly, although she
      neither professed nor felt any particular devotion to religious ideals or
      tenets. She gave of her substance generously, though not profusely, to all
      properly organized and certified charities, but did not look about for, or
      often recognize when they came in her way, subjects for private
      benefaction. She applied the bulk of her leisure time to the writing of
      long and perfectly commonplace letters to female relatives in various
      sections of the Republic. She was profoundly fond of her daughters, but
      was rarely impelled to demonstrative proofs of this affection. Very often
      she grew tired of inaction, mental and physical; but she accepted this
      without murmuring as a natural and proper result of her condition in life,
      much as one accepts an uncomfortable sense of repletion after a dinner.
      When she did not know what else to do, she ordinarily took a nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been by the law of oppositive attraction that her chosen
      intimate was Miss Tabitha Wilcox, the spare and angular little lady who
      sat across the table from her, the sole guest at the Thanksgiving dinner.
      The most vigorous imagination could not conceive <i>her</i> in the act of
      dozing for so much as an instant during hours when others kept awake.
      Vigilant observation and an unwearying interest in affairs were written in
      every line of her face: you could read them in her bright, sharp eyes; in
      the alert, almost anxious posture of her figure; in the very conformation
      of the little rows of iron-gray curls, which mounted like circular steps
      above each ear. She was a kindly soul, was Miss Tabitha, who could not
      listen unmoved to any tale of honest suffering, and who gave of her
      limited income to the poor with more warmth than prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her position in Thessaly was a unique one. She belonged, undoubtedly, to
      the first families, for her grandfather, Judge Abijah Wilcox, had been one
      of the original settlers, in those halcyon years following the close of
      the Revolution, when the good people of Massachusetts and Connecticut
      swarmed, uninvited, across the Hudson, and industriously divided up among
      themselves the territorial patrimony of the slow and lackadaisical
      Dutchmen. Miss Tabitha still lived in the roomy old house which the judge
      had built; she sat in one of the most prominent pews in the Episcopal
      church, and her prescriptive right to be president of the Dorcas Mite
      Society had not been questioned now these dozen years. Although she was
      far from being wealthy, her place in the very best and most exclusive
      society of Thessaly was taken for granted by everybody. But Miss Tabitha
      was herself not at all exclusive. She knew most of the people in the
      village: only the insuperable limitations of time and space prevented her
      knowing them all. And not even these stern barriers availed to bound her
      information concerning alike acquaintances and strangers. There were
      persons who mistook her eager desire to be of service in whatever was
      going forward for meddlesomeness. Some there were who even resented her
      activity, and thought of her as a malevolent old gossip. These latter were
      deeply in the wrong. Miss Tabitha loved everybody, and had never
      consciously done injury to any living soul. As for gossip, she could no
      more help talking than the robin up in the elm boughs of a sunny April
      morning can withhold the song that is in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that the presence of the butler threw a gloom over the
      dinner-party. It did not silence Miss Tabitha, but at least she felt
      constrained to discourse upon general and impersonal subjects while he was
      in hearing. The two daughters of the house, who faced each other at the
      ends of the table, asked her questions or offered comments at intervals,
      and once or twice their mother spoke. All ate from the plates that were
      set before them, in a perfunctory way, without evidence of appreciation.
      There was some red wine in a decanter on the table&mdash;I fancy none of
      them could have told precisely what it was&mdash;and of this Miss Tabitha
      drank a little, diluted with water. The two girls had allowed the butler
      to fill their glasses as well, and from time to time they made motions as
      of sipping from these, merely to keep their guest in company. Mrs. Minster
      had no wine-glasses at her plate, and drank ice-water. Every time that any
      one of the others lifted the wine to her lips, a common thought seemed to
      flash through the minds around the table&mdash;the memory of the son and
      heir who had died from drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the butler, with an accession of impressiveness in his reserved
      demeanor, at last handed around plates containing each its thin layer of
      pale meat, Ethel Minster was moved to put into words what all had been
      feeling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, this isn&rsquo;t like Thanksgiving at all!&rdquo; she said, with the freedom
      of a favorite child; &ldquo;it was ever so much nicer to have the turkey on the
      table where we could all see him, and pick out in our minds what part we
      would especially like. To have the carving done outside, and only slices
      of the breast brought in to us&mdash;it is as if we were away from home
      somewhere, in a hotel among strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster, by way of answer, looked at the butler, the glance being not
      so much an inquiry as a reference of the matter to one who was a professor
      of this particular sort of thing. Her own inclination jumped with that of
      her daughter, but the possession of a butler entailed certain
      responsibilities, which must be neither ignored nor evaded. Happily
      Cozzens&rsquo;s mind was not wholly inelastic. He uttered no word, but, with a
      slight obeisance which comprehended mistress and daughter and guest in
      careful yet gracious gradations of significance, went out, and presently
      returned with a huge dish, which he set in front of Mrs. Minster. He
      brought the carving instruments, and dignifiedly laid them in their place,
      as a chamberlain might invest a queen with her sceptre. Even when Miss
      Kate said, &ldquo;If we need you any more, Cozzens, we will ring,&rdquo; he betrayed
      neither surprise nor elation, but bowed again gravely, and left the room,
      closing the door noiselessly behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he will turn out a perfect jewel,&rdquo; said Miss Tabitha. &ldquo;You were
      very fortunate to get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are times,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;when one likes to take off one&rsquo;s rings,
      even if the stones are perfection itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This guarded reference to the fact that Mrs. Minster had secured an
      admirable servant who was a nuisance at small feminine dinner-parties
      sufficed to dismiss the subject. Miss Tabitha assumed on the moment a more
      confidential manner and tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that young Horace Boyce has come
      back. Why, now I think of it, he must have come up in your train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in our car,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;He sat by us, and talked all
      the way up. I never heard a man&rsquo;s tongue run on so in all my born days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He takes that from his grandmother Beekman,&rdquo; explained Miss Tabitha, by
      way of parenthesis. &ldquo;She was something dreadful: talking &lsquo;thirteen to the
      dozen&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t begin to express it. You don&rsquo;t remember her. She went down
      to New York when I was a mere slip of a girl, to have a set of false teeth
      fitted&mdash;they were a novelty in those days&mdash;and it was winter
      time, and she wouldn&rsquo;t listen to the dentist&rsquo;s advice to keep her mouth
      shut, and she caught cold, and it turned into lockjaw, and that was the
      last of her. It was just after her daughter Julia had been married to
      young Sylvanus Boyce. Dear me, how time flies! I can remember her old
      bombazine gown and her black Spanish mits, and her lace cap on one side of
      her head, as if it were only yesterday. And here Julia&rsquo;s been dead twenty
      years and more, and her grown-up son&rsquo;s come home from Europe, and the
      General&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old maid stopped short, because her sentence could not be charitably
      finished. &ldquo;How did <i>you</i> like Horace?&rdquo; she asked, to shift the
      subject, and looking at Kate Minster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall, dark girl with the rich complexion and the beautiful, proud eyes
      glanced up at her questioner impatiently, as if disposed to resent the
      inquiry. Then she seemed to reflect that no offence could possibly have
      been intended, for she answered pleasantly enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed an amiable sort of person; and I should judge he was clever,
      too. He always was a smart boy&mdash;I think that is the phrase. He talked
      to mamma most of the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that, Kate? I&rsquo;m sure it was because you scarcely answered
      him at all, and read your book&mdash;which was not very polite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid to venture upon anything more than monosyllables with him,&rdquo;
       said Kate, &ldquo;or I should have been ruder still. I should have had to tell
      him that I did not like Americans who made the accident of their having
      been to Europe an excuse for sneering at those who haven&rsquo;t been there, and
      that would have been highly impolite, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he sneered,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;I thought he tried to
      be as affable and interesting as he knew how. Pray what did he say that
      was sneering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me, I don&rsquo;t in the least remember what he said. It was his tone,
      I think, more than any special remark. He had an air of condoling with me
      because he had seen so many things that I have only read about; and he
      patronized the car, and the heating-apparatus, and the conductor, and the
      poor little black porter, and all of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a pretty boy. Does he hold his own, now he&rsquo;s grown up?&rdquo; asked Miss
      Tabitha. &ldquo;He used to favor the Boyce side a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say he favored the Boyce side to the exclusion of everybody
      else&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; said Kate, with a little smile at her own conceit,
      &ldquo;particularly his own individual section of it. He is rather tall, with
      light hair, light eyes, light mustache, light talk, light everything; and
      he looks precisely like all the other young men you see in New York
      nowadays, with their coats buttoned in just such a way, and their gloves
      of just such a shade, and a scarf of just such a shape with the same kind
      of pin in it, and their hats laid sidewise in the rack so that you can
      observe that they have a London maker&rsquo;s brand in-side. There! you have his
      portrait to a <i>t</i>. Do you recognize it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will poor countrified Thessaly ever do with such a metropolitan
      model as this?&rdquo; asked Ethel. &ldquo;We shall all be afraid to go out in the
      street, for fear he should discover us to be out of the fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is not going to stay here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;He told us that he
      had decided to enter some law firm in New York. It seems a number of very
      flattering openings have been offered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to know,&rdquo; put in Miss Tabitha, &ldquo;that he <i>is</i> going to stay
      here. What is more, he has as good as struck up a partnership with Reuben
      Tracy. I had it this morning from a lady whose brother-in-law is extremely
      intimate with the General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very curious,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;He certainly talked yesterday
      of settling in New York, and mentioned the offers he had had, and his
      doubt as to which to accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure, mamma,&rdquo; commented Kate, &ldquo;that he wasn&rsquo;t talking merely to
      hear himself talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the looks of that Reuben Tracy,&rdquo; interposed Ethel. &ldquo;He always
      suggests the idea that he is the kind of man you could tie something to,
      and come back hours afterward and find it all there just as you had left
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl broke into an amused laugh at the appearance of this metaphor,
      when she had finished it, and the others joined in her gayety. Under the
      influence of this much-needed enlivenment, Miss Tabitha took another piece
      of turkey and drank some of her wine and water. They began talking about
      Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a good thing for Horace Boyce,&rdquo; said Miss Tabitha. &ldquo;He
      couldn&rsquo;t have a steadier or better partner for business. They tell me that
      Tracy handles more work, as it is, than any other two lawyers in town.
      He&rsquo;s a very good-hearted man too, and charitable, as everybody will admit
      who knows him. What a pity it is that he doesn&rsquo;t take an interest in
      church affairs, and rent a pew, and set an example to young men in that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I sometimes think, Tabitha,&rdquo; said Miss Kate, idly
      crumbling the bread on the cloth before her, &ldquo;that it is worth while to
      have an occasional good man or woman altogether outside the Church. They
      prevent those on the inside from getting too conceited about their own
      virtues. There would be no living with the parsons and the deacons and the
      rest if you couldn&rsquo;t say to them now and then: &lsquo;See, you haven&rsquo;t a
      monopoly of goodness. Here are people just as honest and generous and
      straightforward as you are yourselves, who get along without any altar or
      ark whatever.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster looked at her daughter with an almost imperceptible lifting
      of the brows. Her comment had both apology and mild reproof in it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear Kate talk, one would think she was a perfect atheist. She is
      always defending infidels and such people. I am sure I can&rsquo;t imagine where
      she takes it from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mamma!&rdquo; protested the girl, &ldquo;who has said anything about infidels?
      We have no earthly right to brand people with that word, simply because we
      don&rsquo;t see them going to church as we do. We none of us know this Mr. Tracy
      to even bow to him&mdash;at least I don&rsquo;t&mdash;and we know no more about
      his religious opinions than we do about&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;about
      the man in the moon. But I have heard others speak of him frequently, and
      always with respect. I wasn&rsquo;t defending him. Why should I? I merely said
      it was worth while to keep in mind that men could be good without renting
      a pew in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you speak against religion, that is all,&rdquo; replied
      the mother, placidly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;ladylike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you come to inquire,&rdquo; interposed Miss Tabitha, speaking with great
      gentleness, as of one amiably admonishing impetuous and ill-informed
      youth, &ldquo;you will generally find that there is something not quite as it
      should be about these people who are so sure that they need no help to be
      good. Only last evening Sarah Cheeseborough told me something about your
      Mr. Tracy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> Mr. Tracy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about <i>the</i> Mr. Tracy, then, that she saw with her own eyes. I
      would scarcely have believed it. It only goes to show what poor worms the
      best of us are, if we just rely upon our own strength alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Minster, with a slight show of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Tabitha by way of answer threw a meaning glance at the two girls, and
      discreetly took a sip of her wine and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind us, Tabitha!&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;I am twenty-three, and Ethel is
      nearly twenty, and we are allowed to sit up at the table quite as if we
      were grown people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sarcasm was framed in pleasantry, and Miss Tabitha took it in smiling
      good part, with no further pretence of reservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you must know that Ben Lawton&mdash;he&rsquo;s a shiftless sort of
      coot who lives out in the hollow, and picks up odd jobs; the sort of
      people who were brought up on the canal, and eat woodchucks&mdash;Ben
      Lawton has a whole tribe of daughters. Some of them work around among the
      farmers, and some are in the button factory, and some are at home doing
      nothing; and the oldest of the lot, she ran away from here five years ago
      or so, and went to Tecumseh. She was a good-looking girl&mdash;she worked
      one season for my sister near Tyre, and I really liked her looks&mdash;but
      she went altogether to the dogs, and, as I say, quit these parts,
      everybody supposed for good. But, lo and behold! what must she do but turn
      up again like a bad penny, after all this time, and, now I think of it,
      come back on the very train you travelled by, yesterday, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing very remarkable about that,&rdquo; commented Kate. &ldquo;So far as
      I have seen, one doesn&rsquo;t have to show a certificate of character to buy a
      railway ticket. The man at the window scowls upon the just and the unjust
      with impartial incivility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wait,&rdquo; continued Miss Tabitha, impressively, &ldquo;wait till you have
      heard all! This girl&mdash;Jess Lawton, they call her&mdash;drove home on
      the express-sleigh with her father right in broad daylight. And who do you
      think followed up there on foot&mdash;in plain sight, too&mdash;and went
      into the house, and stayed there a full half hour? Why, the immaculate Mr.
      Tracy! Sarah Cheeseborough saw him pass the place, and watched him go into
      their house&mdash;you can see across lots from her side windows to where
      the Lawtons live&mdash;and just for curiosity she kept track of the time.
      The girl hadn&rsquo;t been home an hour before he made his appearance, and Sarah
      vows she hasn&rsquo;t seen him on that road before in years. <i>Now</i> what do
      you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Sarah Cheesborough might profitably board up her side windows. It
      would help her to concentrate her mind on her own business,&rdquo; said Kate.
      Her sister Ethel carried this sentiment farther by adding: &ldquo;So do I! She
      is a mean, meddlesome old cat. I&rsquo;ve heard you say so yourself, Tabitha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two elder ladies took a different view of the episode, and let it be
      seen; but Mrs. Minster seized the earliest opportunity of changing the
      topic of conversation, and no further mention was made during the
      afternoon of either Reuben Tracy or the Lawtons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was, indeed, brought up later on, when the two girls were
      alone together in the little boudoir connecting their apartments.
      Pale-faced Ethel sat before the fire, dreamily looking into the coals,
      while her sister stood behind her, brushing out and braiding for the night
      the younger maiden&rsquo;s long blonde hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Kate,&rdquo; said Ethel, after a long pause, &ldquo;it hurt me almost as
      if that Mr. Tracy had been a friend of ours, when Tabitha told about him
      and&mdash;and that woman. It is so hard to have to believe evil of
      everybody. You would like to think well of some particular person whom you
      have seen&mdash;just as a pleasant fancy of the mind&mdash;and straightway
      they come and tell odious things about him. Didn&rsquo;t it annoy you? And did
      you believe it?&rdquo; Kate drew the ivory brush slowly over the flowing,
      soft-brown ringlets lying across her hand, again and again, but kept
      silence until Ethel repeated her latter question. Then she said,
      evasively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we get to be old maids, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t spend our time in collecting
      people&rsquo;s shortcomings, as boys collect postage-stamps, shall we, dear?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER&rsquo;S WELCOME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he President of
      the United States, that year, had publicly professed himself of the
      opinion that &ldquo;the maintenance of pacific relations with all the world, the
      fruitful increase of the earth, the rewards accruing to honest toil
      throughout the land, and the nation&rsquo;s happy immunity from pestilence,
      famine, and disastrous visitations of the elements,&rdquo; deserved exceptional
      recognition at the hands of the people on the last Thursday in November.
      The Governor of the State went further, both in rhetorical exuberance and
      in his conception of benefits received, for he enumerated &ldquo;the absence of
      calamitous strife between capital and labor,&rdquo; &ldquo;the patriotic spirit which
      had dominated the toilers of the mine, the forge, the factory, and the
      mill, in their judicious efforts to unite and organize their common
      interests,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the wise and public-spirited legislation which in the
      future, like a mighty bulwark, would protect the great and all-important
      agricultural community from the debasing competition of unworthy wares&rdquo;&mdash;as
      among the other things for which everybody should be thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many, no doubt, who were conscious of a kindly glow as they
      read beneath the formal words designating the holiday, and caught the
      pleasant and gracious significance of the Thanksgiving itself&mdash;strange
      and perverted survival as it is of a gloomy and unthankful festival. There
      were others, perhaps, who smiled a little at his Excellency&rsquo;s shrewd
      effort to placate the rising and hostile workingmen&rsquo;s movement and get
      credit from the farmers for the recent oleomargarine bill, and for the
      rest took the day merely as a welcome breathing spell, with an additional
      drink or two in the forenoon, and a more elaborate dinner than was usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Lawton household they troubled their heads neither about the text
      and tricks of the proclamations nor the sweet and humane meaning of the
      day. There were much more serious matters to think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parable of the Prodigal Son has long been justly regarded as a model
      of terse and compact narrative; but modern commentators of the analytical
      sort have a quarrel with the abruptness of its ending. They would have
      liked to learn what the good stay-at-home son said and did after his
      father had for a second time explained the situation to him. Did he, at
      least outwardly, agree that &ldquo;it was meet that we should make merry and be
      glad&rdquo;? And if he consented to go into the house, and even to eat some of
      the fatted calf, did he do it with a fine, large, hearty pretence of being
      glad? Did he deceive the returned Prodigal, for example, into believing in
      the fraternal welcome? Or did he lie in wait, and, when occasion offered,
      quietly, and with a polite smile, rub gall and vinegar into the wayfarer&rsquo;s
      wounds? Alas, this we can only guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ben Lawton had been left in no doubt as to the attitude of his family
      toward the prodigal daughter. A sharp note of dissent had been raised at
      the outset, on the receipt of her letter&mdash;a note so shrill and
      strenuous that for the moment it almost scared him into begging her not to
      come. Then his better nature asserted itself, and he contrived to mollify
      somewhat the wrath of his wife and daughters by inventing a tortuous
      system of lies about Jessica&rsquo;s intentions and affairs. He first
      established the fiction that she meant only to pay them a flying visit.
      Upon this he built a rambling edifice of falsehood as to her financial
      prosperity, and her desire to do a good deal toward helping the family.
      Lastly, as a crowning superstructure of deception, he fabricated a theory
      that she was to bring with her a lot of trunks filled with costly and
      beautiful dresses, with citified bonnets and parasols and high-heeled
      shoes, beyond belief&mdash;all to be distributed among her sisters. Once
      well started, he lied so luxuriantly and with such a flowing fancy about
      these things, that his daughters came to partially believe him&mdash;him
      whom they had not believed before since they could remember&mdash;and
      prepared themselves to be civil to their half-sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were five of these girls&mdash;the offspring of a second marriage
      Lawton contracted a year or so after the death of baby Jessica&rsquo;s mother.
      The eldest, Melissa, was now about twenty, and worked out at the Fairchild
      farm-house some four miles from Thessaly&mdash;a dull, discontented young
      woman, with a heavy yet furtive face and a latent snarl in her voice.
      Lucinda was two years younger, and toiled in the Scotch-cap factory in the
      village. She also was a commonplace girl, less obviously bad-tempered than
      Melissa, but scarcely more engaging in manner. Next in point of age was
      Samantha, who deserves some notice by herself, and after her came the
      twins, Georgiana and Arabella, two overgrown, coarse, giggling hoydens of
      fifteen, who obtained intermittent employment in the button factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Samantha, although but seventeen, had for some time been tacitly
      recognized as the natural leader of the family. She did no work either in
      factory or on farm, and the local imagination did not easily conceive a
      condition of things in which she could find herself reduced to the strait
      of manual labor. Her method, baldly stated, was to levy more or less
      reluctant contributions upon whatever the rest of the family brought in.
      There was a fiction abroad that Samantha stayed at home to help her
      mother. The facts were that she was only visible at the Law-ton domicile
      at meal-times and during inclement weather, and that her mother was rather
      pleased than otherwise at this being the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samantha was of small and slight figure, with a shrewd,
      prematurely-sapient face that was interesting rather than pretty, and with
      an eye which, when it was not all demure innocence, twinkled coldly like
      that of a rodent of prey. She had several qualities of mind and deportment
      which marked her as distinct from the mass of village girls; that which
      was most noticeable, perhaps, was her ability to invent and say sharp,
      comical, and cuttingly sarcastic things without herself laughing at them.
      This was felt to be a rare attainment indeed in Thessaly, and its
      possession gave her much prestige among the young people of both sexes,
      who were conscious of an insufficient command alike over their tongues and
      their boisterous tendencies. Samantha could have counted her friends, in
      the true, human sense of the word, upon her thumbs; but of admirers and
      toadies she swayed a regiment. Her own elder sisters, Melissa and Lucinda,
      alternated between sulky fear of her and clumsy efforts at propitiation;
      the junior twins had never as yet emerged from a plastic state of
      subordination akin to reverence. Samantha&rsquo;s attitude toward them all was
      one of lofty yet observant criticism, relieved by lapses into
      half-satirical, half-jocose amiability as their pay-days approached. On
      infrequent occasions she developed a certain softness of demeanor toward
      her father, but to her mother she had been uniformly and contemptuously
      uncivil for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this mother, the second Mrs. Lawton, there is little enough to say. She
      was a pallid, ignorant, helpless slattern, gaunt of frame, narrow of
      forehead, and bowed and wrinkled before her time. Like her husband, she
      came of an ancestry of lake and canal boatmen; and though twenty odd years
      had passed since increasing railroad competition forced her parents to
      abandon their over-mortgaged scow and seek a living in the farm country,
      and she married the young widower Ben Lawton in preference to following
      them, her notions of housekeeping and of existence generally had never
      expanded beyond the limits of a canal-boat cabin. She rose at a certain
      hour, maundered along wearily through such tasks of the day as forced
      themselves upon her, and got to bed again as early as might be, inertly
      thankful that the day was done. She rarely went out upon the street, and
      still more rarely had any clothes fit to go out in. She had a vague pride
      in her daughter Samantha, who seemed to her to resemble the heroines of
      the continued stories which she assiduously followed in the <i>Fireside
      Weekly</i>, and sometimes she harbored a formless kind of theory that if
      her baby boy Alonzo had lived, things would have been different; but her
      interest in the rest of the family was of the dimmest and most spasmodic
      sort. In England she would have taken to drink, and been beaten for it,
      and thus at least extracted from life&rsquo;s pilgrimage some definite
      sensations. As it was, she lazily contributed vile cooking, a foully-kept
      house, and a grotesque waste of the pittances which came into her hands,
      to the general squalor which hung like an atmosphere over the Lawtons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house to which Jessica had come with her father the previous afternoon
      was to her a strange abode. At the time of her flight, five years before,
      the family had lived on a cross-road some miles away; at present they were
      encamped, so to speak, in an old and battered structure which had been a
      country house in its time, but was now in the centre of a new part of
      Thessaly built up since war. The building, with its dingy appearance and
      poverty-stricken character, was an eyesore to the neighborhood, and
      everybody looked hopefully forward to the day when the hollow in which it
      stood should be filled up, and the house and its inhabitants cleared away
      out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica upon her arrival had been greeted with constrained coolness by her
      stepmother, who did not even offer to kiss her, but shook hands limply
      instead, and had been ushered up to her room by her father. It was a low
      and sprawling chamber, with three sides plastered, and the fourth
      presenting a time-worn surface of naked lathing. In it were a bed, an old
      chest of drawers, a wooden chair, and a square piece of rag carpet just
      large enough to emphasize the bareness of the surrounding floor. This was
      the company bedroom; and after Ben had brought up all her belongings and
      set them at the foot of the bed, and tiptoed his way down-stairs again,
      Jessica threw herself into the chair in the centre of its cold desolation,
      and wept vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came after a time, while she still sat sobbing in solitude, a soft
      rap at her door. When it was repeated, a moment later, she hastily
      attempted to dry her eyes, and answered, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Then the door opened,
      and the figure of Samantha appeared. She was smartly dressed, and she had
      a half-smile on her face. She advanced readily toward the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; she said, as Jessica rose and looked at her
      doubtfully in the fading light. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Samantha. Of course, I&rsquo;ve grown a
      good deal; but Lord! I&rsquo;d have known you anywhere. I&rsquo;m glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone betrayed no extravagance of heated enthusiasm, but still it <i>was</i>
      a welcome in its way; and as the two girls kissed each other, Jessica
      choked down the last of her sobs, and was even able to smile a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I should have known you,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Oh, now I look at
      you, of course I should. Yes, you&rsquo;ve grown into a fine girl. I&rsquo;ve thought
      of you very, very often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet not half as often as I&rsquo;ve thought of you,&rdquo; Samantha made answer,
      cheerfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been living in a big city, where there&rsquo;s plenty to
      take up your time; but it gets all-fired slow down here sometimes, and
      then there&rsquo;s nothing to do but to envy them that&rsquo;s been able to get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samantha had been moving the small pieces of luggage at the foot of the
      bed with her feet as she spoke. With her eyes still on them she asked, in
      a casual way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father gone for the rest of your things? It&rsquo;s like him to make two jobs
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all I have brought; there is nothing more,&rdquo; said Jessica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samantha was eying her sister with open-mouthed incredulity. She stammered
      forth, after a prolonged pause of mental confusion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you ain&rsquo;t brought any swell dresses, or fancy bonnets, or
      silk wrappers, or sealskins, or&mdash;or anything? Why, dad swore you was
      bringing whole loads of that sort of truck with you!&rdquo; She added, as if in
      angry quest for consolation: &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one comfort, he always <i>was</i>
      a liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if you&rsquo;re disappointed,&rdquo; said Jessica, stiffly; &ldquo;but this is
      all I&rsquo;ve brought, and I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have had no end of swell things,&rdquo; retorted the younger girl.
      &ldquo;It stands to reason you must. I know that much. And what have you done
      with &rsquo;em?&rdquo; She broke out in loud satire: &ldquo;Oh, yes! A precious lot
      you thought about me and the rest of us! I daresay it kept you awake
      nights, thinking about us so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica gazed in painful astonishment at this stripling girl, who had
      regarded her melancholy home-coming merely in the light of a chance to
      enjoy some cast-off finery. All the answers that came into her head were
      too bitter and disagreeable. She did not trust herself to reply, but,
      still wearing her hat and jacket, walked to the window and looked out down
      the snowy road. The impulse was strong within her to leave the house on
      the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samantha had gone away, slamming the door viciously behind her, and
      Jessica stood for a long time at the window, her mind revolving in
      irregular and violent sequence a score of conflicting plans and passionate
      notions. There were moments in this gloomy struggle of thought when she
      was tempted to throw everything to the winds&mdash;her loyalty to
      pure-souled Annie Fairchild, her own pledges to herself, her hopes and
      resolves for the future, everything&mdash;and not try any more. And when
      she had put these evil promptings behind her, that which remained was only
      less sinister.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood thus, frowning down through the unwashed panes at the white,
      cheerless prospect, and tearing her heart in the tumultuous revery of
      revolt, the form of a man advancing up the road came suddenly under her
      view. He stopped when he was in front of the Lawton house, and looked
      inquiringly about him. The glance which he directed upwards fell full upon
      her at the window. The recognition was mutual, and he turned abruptly from
      the road and came toward the house. Jessica hurriedly took off her hat and
      cloak. Reuben Tracy had come to see her!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her stepmother who climbed the stairs to notify her, looking more
      lank and slatternly than ever, holding the bedroom door wide open, and
      saying sourly: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man down-stairs to see you already,&rdquo; as if the
      visit were an offence, and Jessica could not pretend to be surprised.
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw him,&rdquo; she answered, and hurried past Mrs. Lawton, and down to
      the gaunt, dingy front room, with its bare walls, scant furniture, and
      stoveless discomfort, which not even Samantha dared call a parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could remember afterward that Reuben stood waiting for her with his
      hat in his left hand, and that he had taken the glove from his right to
      shake hands with her; and this she recalled more distinctly than anything
      else. He had greeted her with grave kindness, had mentioned receiving
      notice from the Fairchilds of her coming, and had said that of course
      whatever he could do to help her he desired to do. Then there had been a
      pause, during which she vaguely wavered between a wish that he had not
      come, and a wild, childish longing to hide her flushed face against his
      overcoat, and weep out her misery. What she did do was to point to a
      chair, and say, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of you to come,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off
      suddenly and looked away from him, and through the window at the
      snow-banks outside. &ldquo;How early the winter has closed in,&rdquo; she added, with
      nervous inconsequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben did not even glance out at the snow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to say that it
      isn&rsquo;t very clear to me what use I can be to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m
      all in the dark as to what you intend to do. Mr. Fairchild did not mention
      that you had any definite plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought some of starting a milliner&rsquo;s shop, of course very small,
      by myself. You know I have been working in one for some months at
      Tecumseh, ever since Mrs. Fairchild&mdash;ever since she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not finish the sentence, for Reuben nodded gravely, as if he
      understood, and that seemed to be all that was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might do,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, and speaking even more
      deliberately than usual. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to tell you this doesn&rsquo;t seem
      to me a specially wise thing, your coming back here. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand
      me; I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything to discourage you, for the world. And since
      you <i>have</i> come, it wasn&rsquo;t of much use, perhaps, to say that. Still,
      I wanted to be frank with you, and I don&rsquo;t understand why you did come. It
      doesn&rsquo;t appear that the Fairchilds thought it was wise, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> did,&rdquo; answered Jessica, quickly, &ldquo;because she understood what
      I meant&mdash;what I had in mind to do when I got here. But I&rsquo;m sure he
      laughed at it when she explained it to him; she didn&rsquo;t say so, but I know
      he did. He is a man, and men don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben smiled a little, but still compassionately. &ldquo;Then perhaps I would
      better give it up in advance, without having it explained at all,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; when I saw your name on the sign, down on Main Street, this
      afternoon, I knew that you would see what I meant. I felt sure you would:
      you are different from the others. You were kind to me when I was a girl,
      when nobody else was. You know the miserable childhood I had, and how
      everybody was against me&mdash;all but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica had begun calmly enough, but she finished with something very like
      a sob, and, rising abruptly, went to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben sat still, thinking over his reply. The suggestion that he differed
      from the general run of men was not precisely new to his mind, but it had
      never been put to him in this form before, and he was at a loss to see its
      exact bearings. Perhaps, too, men are more nearly alike in the presence of
      a tearful young woman than under most other conditions. At all events, it
      took him a long time to resolve his answer&mdash;until, in fact, the
      silence had grown awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you have a pleasant recollection of me,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I
      remember you very well, and I was very sorry when you left the school.&rdquo; He
      had touched the painful subject rather bluntly, but she did not turn or
      stir from her post near the window, and he forced himself forward. &ldquo;I was
      truly much grieved when I heard of it, and I wished that I could have
      talked with you, or could have known the circumstances in time, or&mdash;that
      is to say&mdash;that I could have helped you. Nothing in all my teacher
      experience pained me more. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk of it,&rdquo; she broke in. Then she turned and came close
      beside him, and lifted her hand as if to place it on his shoulder by a
      frank gesture of friendship. The hand paused in mid-air, and then sank to
      her side. &ldquo;I know you were always as good as good could be. You don&rsquo;t need
      to tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wasn&rsquo;t telling you that, I hope,&rdquo; he rejoined, speaking more freely
      now. &ldquo;But you have never answered my question. What is it that Seth
      Fairchild failed to understand, yet which you are sure I will comprehend?
      Perhaps it is a part of your estimate of me that I should see without
      being told; but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason for coming back? I hardly know how to explain it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben made no comment upon this, and after a moment she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds unlikely and self-conceited, but for months back I have been
      full of the idea. It was her talk that gave me the notion. I want to be a
      friend to other girls placed as I was when I went to your school, with
      miserable homes and miserable company, and hating the whole thing as I
      hated it, and aching to get away from it, no matter how; and I want to try
      and keep them from the pitch-hole I fell into. That&rsquo;s what I want&mdash;only
      I can&rsquo;t explain it to you as I could to <i>her</i>; and you think it&rsquo;s
      silly, don&rsquo;t you? And I&mdash;begin to think&mdash;so&mdash;myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben had risen now and stood beside her, and put his hand lightly on her
      shoulder as she finished with this doleful confession. He spoke with grave
      softness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not silly: it seems to me a very notable kind of wisdom. I had been
      thinking only of you, and that you could live more comfortably and happily
      elsewhere. But it seems that you were thinking of matters much greater
      than your own. And that surprises me, and pleases me, and makes me ashamed
      of my own view. Think you silly? My dear child, I think you are superb.
      Only&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke more slowly, and in a less confident tone&mdash;&ldquo;unfortunately,
      though it is wisdom to do the right thing, it doesn&rsquo;t always follow that
      it is easy, or successful for that matter. You will need to be very
      strong, in order to stand up straight under the big task you have
      undertaken&mdash;very strong and resolute indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The touch of his hand upon her shoulder had been more to Jessica than his
      words, the line of which, in truth, she had not clearly followed. And when
      he ended with his exhortation to robust bravery, she was conscious of
      feeling weaker than for months before. The woman&rsquo;s nature that was in her
      softened under the gentle pressure of that strong hand, and all the
      nameless feminine yearnings for wardenship and shelter from life&rsquo;s battle
      took voice and pleaded in her heart. Ah, yes! he spoke of her being
      strong, and the very sound of his voice unnerved her. She could not think;
      there was no answer to be made to his words, for she had scarcely heard
      them. No reply of any kind would come to her lips. In place of a mind, she
      seemed to have only a single sense&mdash;vast, overpowering, glorious&mdash;and
      that was of his hand upon her shoulder. And enwrapped, swallowed up in
      this sense, she stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then lo! the hand was gone, and with a start her wits came back. The
      lawyer was buttoning his overcoat, and saying that he must be going.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands with him mechanically, in confused apprehension lest she
      should think of nothing more to say to him before he departed. She
      followed him to the hall, and opened the front door for him. On the
      threshold the words she wanted came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try to be strong,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I thank you a thousand times for
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you will let me help you; you will come to me freely, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
       Reuben said as he lifted his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; answered Jessica, slowly, as she closed the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;THANKSGIVING AT THE LAWTONS&rsquo;.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he church-bells
      rang out next morning through a crisp and frosty air. A dazzling glare of
      reflected sunshine lay on the dry snow, but it gave no suggestion of
      warmth. The people who passed on their way to Thanksgiving services walked
      hurriedly, and looked as if their minds were concentrated on the hope that
      the sexton had lighted the fire in the church furnace the previous day.
      The milkman who stopped his sleigh just beyond the house of the Law-tons
      had to beat off a great rim of chalk-white ice with the dipper before he
      could open his can.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger members of the Lawton family were not dependent upon external
      evidences, however, for their knowledge that it was bitterly cold. It was
      nearly noon when they began to gather in the kitchen, and cluster about
      the decrepit old cooking-stove where burned the only fire in the house. A
      shivering and unkempt group they made, in the bright daylight, holding
      their red hands over the cracked stove-lids, and snarling sulkily at the
      weather and one another when they spoke at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica had slept badly, and, rising early and dressing in self-defence
      against the cold, had found her father in the act of lighting the kitchen
      fire. An original impulse prompted her to kiss him when she bade him
      good-morning; and Ben, rising awkwardly from where he had been kneeling in
      front of the grate, looked both surprised and shamefacedly gratified. It
      seemed ages since one of his daughters had kissed him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular stinger of a morning, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said, blowing his
      fingers. &ldquo;The boards in the sidewalk jest riz up and went off under my
      feet like pistols last night, when I was coming home.&rdquo; He added with an
      accent of uneasiness: &ldquo;Suppose you didn&rsquo;t hear me come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed pleased when she shook her head, and his face visibly lightened.
      He winked at her mysteriously, and going over to a recess in the wall,
      back of the woodbox, dragged out a lank and dishevelled turkey of a dingy
      gray color, not at all resembling the fowls that had been presented to him
      the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble with me was,&rdquo; he said, reflectively, &ldquo;I shot four turkeys. If I
      hadn&rsquo;t been a bang-up shot, and had only killed one, why, I&rsquo;d been all
      right. But no, I couldn&rsquo;t help hitting &rsquo;em, and so I got four. Of
      course, I hadn&rsquo;t any use for so many: so I got to raffling &rsquo;em off,
      and that&rsquo;s where my darned luck come in.&rdquo; He held the bird up, and turned
      it slowly around, regarding it with an amused chuckle. &ldquo;You know this cuss
      ain&rsquo;t one of them I shot, at all. You see, I got to raffling, and one time
      I stood to win nine turkeys and a lamp and a jag of firewood. But then the
      thing kind o&rsquo; turned, and went agin me, and darn me if I didn&rsquo;t come out
      of the little end of the horn, with nothing but this here. Sh-h!&mdash;M&rsquo;rye&rsquo;s
      coming. Don&rsquo;t say nothing to her. I told her I earnt it carrying in some
      coal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lawton entered the room as her husband was putting back the turkey.
      She offered no remarks beyond a scant &ldquo;mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo; to Jessica, and directed
      a scowl toward Lawton, before which he promptly disappeared. She replied
      curtly in the negative when Jessica asked if there was anything she could
      do; but the novelty of the offer seemed to slowly impress her mind, for
      after a time she began to talk of her own accord. Ben had come home drunk
      the night before, she said; there wasn&rsquo;t anything new in that, but it was
      decidedly new for him to bring something to eat with him. He said he&rsquo;d
      been carrying in coal, which was her reason for believing he had been
      really shaving shingles or breaking up old barrels. He couldn&rsquo;t tell the
      truth if he tried&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t in him not to lie. The worst of his
      getting drunk was he was so pesky good-natured the next day. Her father
      used always to have a headache under similar conditions, and make things
      peculiarly interesting for everybody round about, from her mother at the
      helm of the boat to the nigger-boy and the mule on the tow-path ahead.
      That was the way all other men behaved, too: that is, all who were good
      for anything. But Ben, he just grinned and did more chores than usual, and
      hung around generally, as if everybody was bound to like him because he
      had made a fool of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This monologue of information and philosophy was not delivered
      consecutively, but came in disjointed and irrelevant instalments, spread
      over a considerable space of time. There was nothing in it all which
      suggested a reply, and Jessica did not even take the trouble to listen
      very attentively. Her own thoughts were a more than sufficient occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of the experiment upon which she had ventured was looming in
      unpleasant bulk before her. Every glance about her, every word which fell
      upon her ears, furnished an added reason why she was not going to be able
      to live on the lines she had laid out. Viewed even as a visit, the
      experience was hateful. Contemplated as a career, it was simply
      impossible. Rather than bear it, she would go back to Tecumseh or New
      York; and rather than do this, she would kill herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too depressed to control her thoughts, much less to bend them definitely
      upon consideration of some possible middle course between suicide and
      existence in this house, Jessica sat silent at the back of the stove, and
      suffered. Her evening here with her sisters seemed to blend in retrospect
      with the sleepless night into one long, confused, intolerable nightmare.
      They had scarcely spoken to her, and she had not known what to say to
      them. For some reason they had chosen to stay indoors after supper&mdash;although
      this was plainly not their habit&mdash;and under Samantha&rsquo;s lead had
      entered into a clumsy conspiracy to make her unhappy by meaning looks, and
      causeless giggles, and more or less ingenious remarks directed at her, but
      to one another. Lucinda had indeed seemed to shrink from full communion
      with this cabal, but she had shown no overt act of friendship, and the
      three younger girls had been openly hostile. Even after she had taken
      refuge in her cold room, at an abnormally early hour, her sense of their
      enmity and her isolation had been kept painfully acute by their loud talk
      in the hall, and in the chamber adjoining hers. Oh, no!&mdash;she was not
      even going to try to live with them, she said resolutely and with set
      teeth to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They straggled into the kitchen now, and Lucinda was the only one of them
      who said &ldquo;good-morning&rdquo; to her. Jessica answered her greeting almost with
      effusion, but she would have had her tongue torn out rather than allow it
      to utter a solitary first word to the others. They stood about the stove
      for a time, and then sat down to the bare kitchen table upon which the
      maternal slattern had spread a kind of breakfast. Jessica took her place
      silently, and managed to eat a little of the bread, dipped in pork fat.
      The coffee, a strange, greasy, light-brown fluid without milk, she could
      not bring herself to touch. There was no butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this odious meal was over Samantha brought down a cheap novel, and
      ensconced herself at the side of the stove, with her feet on a stick of
      wood in the oven. The twins, after some protest, entered lazily upon the
      task of plucking the turkey. Lucinda drew a chair to the window, and began
      some repairs on her bonnet. For sheer want of other employment, Jessica
      stood by the window for a time, looking down upon this crude millinery.
      Then she diffidently asked to be allowed to suggest some changes, and
      Lucinda yielded the chair to her; and her deft fingers speedily wrought
      such a transformation in the work that the owner made an exclamation of
      delight. At this the twins left their turkey to come over and look, and
      even Samantha at last quitted the stove and sauntered to the window with
      an exaggerated show of indifference. She looked on for a moment, and then
      returned with a supercilious sniff, which scared the twins also away. When
      the hat was finished, and Lucinda had tried it on with obvious
      satisfaction, Jessica asked her to go for a little walk, and the two went
      out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain physical relief in escaping from the close and
      evil-smelling kitchen into the keen, clear cold, but of mental comfort
      there was little. The sister had nothing beyond a few commonplaces to
      offer in the way of conversation, and Jessica was in no mood to create
      small-talk. She walked vigorously forward as far as the sidewalks were
      shovelled, indifferent to direction and to surroundings, and intent only
      upon the angry and distracting thoughts which tore one another in her
      mind. It was not until the drifts forced them to turn that she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always dread to get downright mad: it makes me sick,&rdquo; she exclaimed, in
      defiant explanation to the dull Lucinda, who did not seem to have enjoyed
      her walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was you, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just keep a stiff upper lip and tend to your own knitting, and
      they&rsquo;ll be coming around in no time to get you to fix their bonnets for &rsquo;em.
      I bet you Samanthy&rsquo;ll have her brown plush hat to pieces, and be bringing
      it to you before Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to bring it to me somewhere else, then. To-day&rsquo;s my last day
      in <i>that</i> house, and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica spoke with such vehemence that Lucinda could only stare at her in
      surprise, and the town girl went excitedly on: &ldquo;When I saw father
      yesterday, I was almost glad I&rsquo;d come back; and you&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ve
      been decent to me, too. But the rest&mdash;ah-h!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been swearing
      in my mind every second since they came into the kitchen this morning. I
      was all for tears yesterday. I started out crying at the dépôt, and I
      cried the best part of last night; but I&rsquo;ve got all through. Do you mind?
      I&rsquo;m through! If there&rsquo;s got to be any more weeping, they&rsquo;re the ones
      that&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ground her teeth together as she spoke, as if to prevent a further
      outpouring of angry words. All at once she stopped, on some sudden
      impulse, and looked her half-sister in the face. It was a long, intent
      scrutiny, under which Lucinda flushed and fidgeted, but its result was to
      soften Jessica&rsquo;s mood. She resumed the walk again, but with a less
      energetic step, and the hard, wrathful lines in her face had begun to
      melt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably there will be no need for any one else to weep,&rdquo; she said,
      ashamed of her recent outburst. &ldquo;God knows, <i>I</i> oughtn&rsquo;t to want to
      make anybody unhappy!&rdquo; Then after a moment&rsquo;s silence she asked: &ldquo;Do you
      work anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job at the Scotch-cap factory as long as it&rsquo;s running.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much can you earn there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three dollars a week is what I&rsquo;m getting, but they&rsquo;re liable to shut down
      any time now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica pondered upon this information for a little. Then she put another
      question, with increased interest. &ldquo;And do you like it at home, with the
      rest of them, there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it? Yes, about as much as a cat likes hot soap. It&rsquo;s worse now a
      hundred times than it was when you lit out. If there was any place to go
      to, I&rsquo;d be off like a shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, here&rsquo;s what I wanted to ask you. When I leave it, what&rsquo;s the
      matter with your coming with me? I mean it. And I&rsquo;ll look after you.&rdquo; The
      girl&rsquo;s revolt against her new and odious environment had insensibly
      carried her back into the free phraseology of her former life. As this was
      equally familiar to Lucinda&rsquo;s factory-attuned ear, it could not have been
      the slang expression at which she halted. But she did stop, and in turn
      looked sharply into Jessica&rsquo;s face. Her own cheeks, red with exposure to
      the biting air, flushed to a deeper tint. &ldquo;You better ask Samantha, if
      that&rsquo;s your game,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s more in your line. I ain&rsquo;t on that lay
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Jessica had fairly comprehended the purport of this remark, her
      sister had started briskly off by herself. The town girl stood bewildered
      for a moment, with a little inarticulate moan of pained astonishment
      trembling on her lips. Then she turned and ran after Lucinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; she panted out as she overtook her. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
      understand me. I wouldn&rsquo;t for a million dollars have you think <i>that</i>
      of me. Please wait, and let me tell you what I really meant. You&rsquo;ll break
      my heart if you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Lucinda stopped, and consented to fall in with the other&rsquo;s
      slower step. She let it be seen plainly enough that she was a hostile
      auditor, but still she listened. As Jessica, with a readier tongue than
      she had found in Reuben Tracy&rsquo;s presence the day before, outlined her
      plan, the factory-girl heard her, first with incredulity, then with
      inter-est, and soon with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with you? You just bet I will!&rdquo; was the form of her adhesion to the
      plan, when it had been presented to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young women extended their walk by tacit consent far beyond the
      original intention, and it was past the hour set for the dinner when they
      at last reluctantly entered the inhospitable-looking domicile. Its shabby
      aspect and the meanness of its poverty-stricken belongings had never
      seemed so apparent before to either of them, as they drew near to it, but
      it was even less inviting within.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were warned that it would be so by their father, whom they
      encountered just outside the kitchen door, chopping up an old plank for
      firewood. Ben had put on a glaringly white paper collar, to mark his sense
      of the importance of the festival, and the effect seemed to heighten the
      gloom on his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the old Harry to pay in there,&rdquo; he said, nodding his head toward
      the door. &ldquo;Melissa&rsquo;s come in from the farm to spend the day, because she
      heard you was here, Jess, and somehow she got the idee you&rsquo;d bring a lot
      of dresses and fixings, and she wanted her share, and got mad because
      there wasn&rsquo;t any; and Samantha she pitched into her about coming to eat up
      our dinner, and M&rsquo;rye she took Melissa&rsquo;s part, and so I kind o&rsquo; sashayed
      out. They don&rsquo;t need this wood any more&rsquo;n a frog needs a tail, but I&rsquo;m
      going to whack &rsquo;er all up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Thanksgiving dinner which shortly ensued had a solitary merit: it did
      not last very long. But hurried as it was, Jessica did not sit it out. The
      three sisters with whom she was not friendly had been quarrelling, it
      seemed, with Melissa, the heavy-browed and surly girl who worked out at
      the Fair-child farm, but all four combined in an instant against the
      new-comers. Lucinda had never shone in repartee, and, though she did not
      shrink from bearing a part in the conflict to which she suddenly found
      herself a party, what she was able to say only made matters worse. As for
      Jessica, she bit her lips in fierce restraint, and for a long time said
      nothing at all. Melissa had formally shaken hands with her, and had not
      spoken a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the thin turkey was put upon the table, and Mrs. Lawton had with some
      difficulty mangled it into eight approximately equal portions, a period of
      silence fell on the party&mdash;silence broken only by sounds of the
      carnivora which are not expected at the banquets of the polite. Even this
      measly fowl, badly cooked and defiled by worse than tasteless dressing
      though it was, represented a treat in the Lawton household, and the
      resident members fell upon it with eager teeth. Melissa sniffed a trifle
      at her portion, to let it be seen that they were better fed out on the
      farm, but she ate vigorously none the less. It was only Jessica who could
      summon no appetite, and who sat silent and sick at heart, wearily striving
      at the pretence of eating in order not to attract attention. She was
      conscious of hostile glances being cast upon her from either side, but she
      kept her eyes as steadily as she could upon her plate or on her father,
      who sat opposite and who smiled at her encouragingly from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the ungracious twins who first attained the leisure in which
      to note Jessica&rsquo;s failure to eat, and commented audibly upon the
      difficulty of catering to the palates of &ldquo;fine ladies.&rdquo; The phrase was
      instantly repeated with a sneering emphasis by Samantha, which was the
      signal for a burst of giggling, in which Melissa joined. Then Samantha,
      speaking very distinctly and with an ostentatious parade of significance,
      informed Melissa that young Horace Boyce had returned to Thessaly only the
      previous day, &ldquo;on the very train which father went down to meet.&rdquo; This
      treatment of Melissa as a vehicle for the introduction of disagreeable
      topics impressed the twins as a shrewd invention, and one of them promptly
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M&rsquo;liss&rsquo;, and who do you think called here yesterday? Reuben Tracy
      the lawyer. He was there in the parlor for half an hour&mdash;pretty cold
      he must have found it&mdash;but he wasn&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;re getting quite fashionable,&rdquo; put in Samantha. &ldquo;Father ought
      to set out a hitching-post and a carriage-block, so that we can receive
      our callers in style. I hope it will be a stone one, dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so do I,&rdquo; broke in Lucinda, angrily, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;d like to see your
      head pounded on it, for all it was worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it was,&rdquo; retorted Samantha, &ldquo;it would make a noise. And that&rsquo;s
      more than yours would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shut up!&rdquo; shouted Ben Lawton, with the over-vehemence of a weak
      nature in excitement. &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t you got no decency nor compassion in ye? Has
      she done any harm to you? Can&rsquo;t you give her a chance&mdash;to&mdash;to
      live it down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the echoes of this loud, indignant voice were still on the air,
      Jessica had pushed her chair back, risen, and walked straight to the door
      leading up-stairs. She looked at nobody as she passed, but held her pale
      face proudly erect, though her lips were quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had opened the door, some words seemed to come to her, and she
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live it down!&rdquo; she said, speaking more loudly than was her wont, to keep
      her faltering voice from breaking. &ldquo;Live it down! Why, father, these
      people don&rsquo;t want me to live at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she closed the door and was seen no more that day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;THE PARTNERSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ither through the
      softening influence of the Thanksgiving festival upon litigious natures,
      or by reason of the relaxing reaction from over-feasting, it happened that
      no clients of any kind visited Reuben Tracy&rsquo;s law office next day. He came
      down early enough to light his own fires in both the inner and outer rooms&mdash;an
      experience for which he had been prepared by long observation of the
      effect produced by holidays upon his clerk&mdash;and he sat for a couple
      of hours by the stove, with his feet on the table and a book in his lap,
      waiting for Horace Boyce to keep the appointment. The book was an old
      collection of Carlyle&rsquo;s earlier essays, and Reuben liked it better,
      perhaps, than any other member of his library family. He had not read it
      through, and there was a good deal in it which he seemed likely never to
      read. But there were other portions, long since very familiar to his mind
      and eye, which it was his habit to go over again whenever he had nothing
      else to do. The rough, thought-compelling diction rested his brain, by
      some curious rule of paradox. In the front of the volume he had written,
      &ldquo;Not new books, but good books,&rdquo; an apothegm adapted from a preface of an
      old English play which had pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was indolently ruminating on the wealth of epithet with which the
      portrait of Cagliostro is painted, when his expected visitor arrived. He
      laughed aloud at some whimsical conceit that this association of people
      suggested, and tossed the book aside as he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been killing time,&rdquo; he said, still smiling, &ldquo;by reading about the
      prize impostor of the eighteenth century. You know it?&mdash;<i>The
      Diamond Necklace</i>. I like to read it. For good, downright swindling and
      effrontery there&rsquo;s nothing anywhere like that fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace glanced at the book as he shook hands and took off his overcoat. He
      said nothing, but made a mental note that Reuben had come to know about
      Carlyle after everybody else had ceased reading him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men sat down together, and their talk for the first hour or
      so was of business matters. Reuben made clear what his practice was like,
      its dimensions, its profits, and its claims upon his time. The railroad
      business had come to him through the influence of his old friend
      Congressman Ansdell, of Tecumseh, and was very important. The farmers in
      the vicinity, too, had brought him the bulk of their patronage in the
      matter of drawing deeds and mortgages&mdash;most frequently the latter, he
      was sorry to say&mdash;because he was a farmer&rsquo;s son. This conveyancing
      work had grown to such proportions, and entailed such an amount of
      consultation, that he had been more and more crowded out from active court
      practice, which he was reluctant to abandon. This was his reason for
      thinking of a partner. Then the conversation drifted into discussion of
      Horace&rsquo;s fitness for the place, and his proper share in the earnings of
      the firm. They went over for dinner to the Dearborn House, where Reuben
      lived, before this branch of the talk was concluded. Upon their return,
      over some cigars which Horace thought very bad, they made more headway,
      and arrived at an understanding satisfactory to both. Reuben printed the
      firm name of &ldquo;Tracy &amp; Boyce&rdquo; on a blotter, to see how it would look,
      and Horace talked confidently of the new business which the long
      connection of his family with Thessaly would bring to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, they&rsquo;ve been here from the very beginning. My great-grandfather
      was county judge here as far back as 1796, almost the first one after the
      county was created. And his son, my great-uncle, was congressman one term,
      and assemblyman for years; and another brother was the president of the
      bank; and my grandfather was the rector of St. Matthew&rsquo;s; and then my
      father being the best-known soldier Dearborn sent out during the war&mdash;what
      I mean is, all this ought to help a good deal. It&rsquo;s something to have a
      name that is as much a part of the place as Thessaly itself. You see what
      I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace finished with an almost nervous query, for it had dawned upon him
      that his companion might not share this high opinion of the value of an
      old name and pedigree. Come to think of it, the Tracys were nobody in
      particular, and he glanced apprehensively at Reuben&rsquo;s large, placid face
      for signs of pique. But there was none visible to the naked eye, and
      Horace lighted a fresh cigar, and put his feet up on the table beside
      those of his new partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay there&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; Reuben remarked after a time. &ldquo;Of
      course there must be, and for that matter I guess a name goes for more in
      our profession than it does anywhere else. I suppose it&rsquo;s natural for
      people to assume that jurisprudence runs in families, like snub-noses and
      drink.&rdquo; As soon as he had uttered this last word, it occurred to him that
      possibly Horace might construe it with reference to his father, and he
      made haste to add:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never told you, I think, about my own career. I don&rsquo;t talk about it
      often, for it makes a fellow sound like Mr. Bounderby in <i>Hard Times</i>&mdash;the
      chap who was always bragging about being a self-made man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d like to hear about it,&rdquo; said Horace. &ldquo;The first I remember of you
      was at the seminary here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was only fifteen years old then, and all the story I&rsquo;ve got dates
      before that. I can just remember when we moved into this part of the world&mdash;coming
      from Orange County. My father had bought a small farm some fifteen miles
      from here, over near Tyre, and we moved onto it in the spring. I was about
      five. I had an older brother, Ezra, and two younger ones. There was a good
      deal of hard work to do, and father tried to do it all himself, and so by
      harvest time he was laid up; and the men who came and got in the crops on
      shares robbed us down to the ground. When winter came, father had to get
      up, whether he was well enough or not, and chop wood for the market, to
      make up for the loss on harvesting. One evening he didn&rsquo;t come home, and
      the team was away all night, too, with mother never going to bed at all,
      and then before daybreak taking Ezra to carry a lantern, and starting
      through the drifts for our patch of woods. They found my father dead in
      the forest, crushed under a falling tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was a terrible winter. I only dimly remember it, or the
      summer that followed. When another winter was coming on, my mother grew
      frightened. Try the best she knew how, she was worse off every month than
      she had been the month before. To pay interest on the mortgage, she had to
      sell what produce we had managed to get in, keeping only a bare moiety for
      ourselves, and to give up the woodland altogether. Soon the roads would be
      blocked; there was not enough fodder for what stock we had, nor even food
      enough for us. We had no store of fuel, and no means of staving off
      starvation. Under stern compulsion, solely to secure a home for her boys,
      my mother married a well-to-do farmer in the neighborhood&mdash;a man much
      older than herself, and the owner of a hundred-acre farm and of the
      mortgages on our own little thirty acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he meant to be a just man, but he was as hard as a steel bloom.
      He was a prodigious worker, and he made us all work, without rest or
      reward. When I was nine years old, narrow-chested and physically delicate,
      I had to get up before sunrise for the milking, and then work all day in
      the hay-field, making and cocking, and obliged to keep ahead of the wagon
      under pain of a flogging. Three years of this I had, and I recall them as
      you might a frightful nightmare. I had some stray schooling&mdash;my
      mother insisted upon that&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t much; and I remember that
      the weekly paper was stopped after that because Ezra and I wasted too much
      time in reading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally my health gave out. My mother feared that I would die, and at
      last gained the point of my being allowed to go to Tyre to school, if I
      could earn my board and clothes there. I went through the long village
      street there, stopping at every house to ask if they wanted a little boy
      to do chores for his board and go to school. I said nothing about clothes
      after the first few inquiries. It took me almost all day to find a place.
      It was nearly the last house in the village. The people happened to want a
      boy, and agreed to take me. I had only to take care of two horses, milk
      four cows, saw wood for three stoves, and run errands. When I lay awake in
      my new bed that night, it was with joy that I had found such a kind family
      and such an easy place!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to school for a year, and learned something&mdash;not much, I
      daresay, but something. Then I went back to the farm, alternating between
      that and other places in Tyre, some better, some worse, until finally I
      had saved eight dollars. Then I told my mother that I was going to
      Thessaly seminary. She laughed at me&mdash;they all laughed&mdash;but in
      the end I had my way. They fitted me out with some clothes&mdash;a vest of
      Ezra&rsquo;s, an old hat, trousers cut perfectly straight and much too short,
      and clumsy boots two sizes too big for me, which had been bought by my
      stepfather in wrath at our continual trouble in the winter to get on our
      stiffened and shrunken boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walked the first ten miles with a light heart. Then I began to grow
      frightened. I had never been to Thessaly, and though I knew pretty well
      from others that I should be well received, and even helped to find work
      to maintain myself, the prospect of the new life, now so close at hand,
      unnerved me. I remember once sitting down by the roadside, wavering
      whether to go on or not. At last I stood on the brow of the hill, and saw
      Thessaly lying in the valley before me. If I were to live a thousand
      years, I couldn&rsquo;t forget that sight&mdash;the great elms, the white
      buildings of the seminary, the air of peace and learning and plenty which
      it all wore. I tell you, tears came to my eyes as I looked, and more than
      once they&rsquo;ve come again, when I&rsquo;ve recalled the picture. I remember, too,
      that later on in the day old Dr. Burdick turned me loose in the library,
      as it were There were four thousand books there, and the sight of them
      took my breath away. I looked at them for a long time, I know, with my
      mouth wide open. It was clear to me that I should never be able to read
      them all&mdash;nobody, I thought, could do that&mdash;but at last I picked
      out a set of the encyclopaedia at the end of the shelf nearest the door,
      and decided to begin there, and at least read as far through the room as I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben stopped here, and relighted his cigar. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my story,&rdquo; he said
      after a pause, as if he had brought the recital up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call that only the preface&mdash;or rather, the prologue,&rdquo; said
      Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the rest is nothing out of the ordinary. I managed to live through
      the four years here&mdash;peddling a little, then travelling for a
      photographer in Tecumseh who made enlarged copies of old pictures
      collected from the farm-houses, then teaching school. I studied law first
      by myself, then with Ansdell at Tecumseh, and then one year in New York at
      the Columbia Law School. I was admitted down there, and had a fair
      prospect of remaining there, but I couldn&rsquo;t make myself like New York. It
      is too big; a fellow has no chance to be himself there. And so I came back
      here; and I haven&rsquo;t done so badly, all things considered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; I should think not!&rdquo; was Horace&rsquo;s hearty comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I see the way now, I think,&rdquo; continued Reuben, meditatively, &ldquo;to
      doing much better still. I see a good many ways in which you can help me
      greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; smiled young Mr. Boyce. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m coming in
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking so much of the business,&rdquo; answered Reuben; &ldquo;there need
      be no borrowing-of trouble about that. But there are things outside that I
      want to do. I spoke a little about this the other day, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said something about going into politics,&rdquo; replied Horace, not so
      heartily. The notion had already risen in his mind that the junior member
      of the new partnership might be best calculated to shine in the arena of
      the public service, if the firm was to go in for that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! not &lsquo;politics&rsquo; in the sense you mean,&rdquo; explained Reuben. &ldquo;My
      ambition doesn&rsquo;t extend beyond this village that we&rsquo;re in. I&rsquo;m not
      satisfied with it; there are a thousand things that we ought to be doing
      better than we are, and I&rsquo;ve got a great longing to help improve them.
      That was what I referred to. That is what has been in my mind ever since
      my return. You spoke about politics just now. Strictly speaking,
      &lsquo;politics&rsquo; ought to embrace in its meaning all the ways by which the
      general good is served, and nothing else. But, as a matter of fact, it has
      come to mean first of all the individual good, and quite often the
      sacrifice of everything else. This is natural enough, I suppose. Unless a
      man watches himself very closely, it is easy for him to grow to attach
      importance to the honor and the profit of the place he holds, and to
      forget its responsibilities. In that way you come to have a whole
      community regarding an office as a prize, as a place to be fought for, and
      not as a place to do more work in than the rest perform. This notion once
      established, why, politics comes naturally enough to mean&mdash;well, what
      it does mean. The politicians are not so much to blame. They merely
      reflect the ideas of the public. If they didn&rsquo;t, they couldn&rsquo;t stand up a
      minute by their own strength. You catch my idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Horace, politely dissembling a slight yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the thing to do is to get at the public mind&mdash;to get the
      people into the right, way of regarding these things. It is no good
      effecting temporary reforms in certain limited directions by outbursts of
      popular feeling; for just as soon as the public indignation cools down,
      back come the abuses. And so they will do inevitably until the people get
      up to a calm, high level of intelligence about the management of such
      affairs as they have in common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; remarked Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course all this is trite commonplace,&rdquo; continued Reuben. &ldquo;You can read
      it in any newspaper any day. My point is in the application of it. It&rsquo;s
      all well enough to say these things in a general way. Everybody knows they
      are true; nobody disputes them any more than the multiplication-table. But
      the exhortation does no good for that very reason. Each reader says: &lsquo;Yes,
      it&rsquo;s too bad that my neighbors don&rsquo;t comprehend these things better;&rsquo; and
      there&rsquo;s an end to the matter. Nothing is effected, because no particular
      person is addressed. Now, my notion is that the way to do is to take a
      single small community, and go at it systematically&mdash;a house-to-house
      canvass, so to speak&mdash;and labor to improve its intelligence, its good
      taste, its general public attitude toward its own public affairs. One can
      fairly count on at least some results, going at it in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said the junior partner, smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ve got a scheme for a sort of society here&mdash;perhaps in
      the nature of a club&mdash;made up of men who have an interest in the town
      and who want to do good. I&rsquo;ve spoken to two or three about it. Perhaps it
      is your coming&mdash;I daresay it is&mdash;but all at once I feel that it
      is time to start it. My notion is it ought to establish as a fundamental
      principle that it has nothing to do with anything outside Thessaly and the
      district roundabout. That is what we need in this country as much as
      anything else&mdash;the habit of minding our own immediate business. The
      newspapers have taught us to attend every day to what is going on in New
      York and Chicago and London and Paris, and every other place under the sun
      except our own. That is an evil. We have become like a gossiping woman who
      spends all her time in learning what her neighbors are doing, and lets the
      fire go out at home. Now, I like to think this can be altered a good deal,
      if we only set to work at it. You have been abroad; you have seen how
      other people do things, and have wider notions than the rest of us, no
      doubt, as to what should be done. What do you say? Does the idea attract
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace&rsquo;s manner confessed to some surprise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty large order,&rdquo;
       he said at last, smilingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never regarded myself as specially cut
      out for a reformer. Still, there&rsquo;s a good deal in what you say. I suppose
      it is practicable enough, when you come really to examine it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, we can try,&rdquo; answered Reuben, with the glow of earnestness
      shining on his face. &ldquo;John Fairchild is almost as fond of the notion as I
      am, and his paper will be of all sorts of use. Then, there&rsquo;s Father
      Chance, the Catholic priest, a splendid fellow, and Dr. Lester, and the
      Rev. Mr. Turner, and a number of others more or less friendly to the
      scheme. I&rsquo;m sure they will all feel the importance of having you in it.
      Your having lived in Europe makes such a difference. You can see things
      with a new eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace gave a little laugh. &ldquo;What my new eye has seen principally so far,&rdquo;
       he said, with an amused smile running through his words, &ldquo;is the
      prevalence of tobacco juice. But of course there are hundreds of things
      our provincial people could learn with profit from Europe. There, for
      example, is the hideous cooking done at all the small places. In England,
      for instance, it is a delight to travel in the country, simply because the
      food is so good in the little rural inns; our country hotel here is a
      horror. Then the roads are so bad here, when they might be made so good.
      The farmer works out his road tax by going out and ploughing up the
      highway, and you break your carriage-wheels in the task of smoothing it
      down again. Porters to carry one&rsquo;s luggage at railway stations&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      something we need, too. And the drinking of light beers and thin,
      wholesome wines instead of whiskey&mdash;that would do a great deal. Then
      men shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to build those ugly flat-topped wooden houses,
      with tin eaves-troughs. No people can grow up to be civilized who have
      these abominations thrust upon their sight daily. And&mdash;oh, I had
      forgotten!&mdash;there ought to be a penal law against those beastly
      sulphur matches with black heads. I lit one by accident the other night,
      and I haven&rsquo;t got the smell of it out of my nostrils yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace ended, as he had begun, with a cheerful chuckle; but his companion,
      who sat looking abstractedly at the snow line of the roofs opposite, did
      not smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are the minor things&mdash;the graces of life,&rdquo; he said, speaking
      slowly. &ldquo;No doubt they have their place, their importance. But I am sick
      at heart over bigger matters&mdash;over the greed for money, the
      drunkenness, the indifference to real education, the neglect of health,
      the immodesty and commonness of our young folks&rsquo; thought and intercourse,
      the narrowness and mental squalor of the life people live all about me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so everywhere, my dear fellow,&rdquo; broke in Horace. &ldquo;You are making us
      worse by comparison than we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we ought to be so infinitely better by comparison! And we have it
      really in us to be better. Only nobody is concerned about the others;
      there is no one to check the drift, to organize public feeling for its own
      improvement. And that&rdquo;&mdash;Reuben suddenly checked himself, and looked
      at his new partner with a smile of wonderful sweetness&mdash;&ldquo;that is what
      I dream of trying to do. And you are going to help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose as he spoke, and Horace, feeling his good impulses fired in a
      vague way by his companion&rsquo;s earnestness and confidence, rose also, and
      stretched out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure I shall do all I can,&rdquo; he said, warmly, as the two shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when young Mr. Boyce went down the narrow stairway by himself, a few
      minutes later, having arranged that the partnership was to begin on the
      approaching 1st of December, he really fancied himself as a
      public-spirited reformer, whose life was to be consecrated to noble deeds.
      He was conscious of an added expansion of breast as he buttoned his fur
      coat across it, and he walked down the village street in a maze of proud
      and pleasant reflections upon his own admirable qualities.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;MR. SCHUYLER TENNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two or three weeks after the new sign of &ldquo;Tracy &amp; Boyce&rdquo; had been hung
      upon the outer walls of Thessaly it happened that the senior partner was
      out of town for the day, and that during his absence the junior partner
      received an important visit from Mr. Schuyler Tenney. Although this
      gentleman was not a client, his talk with Horace was so long and
      interesting that the young lawyer felt justified in denying himself to
      several callers who were clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schuyler Tenney, who has a considerable part to play in this story,
      did not upon first observations reveal any special title to prominence. To
      the cursory glance, he looked like any other of ten hundred hundreds of
      young Americans who are engaged in making more money than they need. I
      speak of him as young because, though there was a thick sprinkling of gray
      in his closely cut hair, and his age in years must have been above rather
      than below forty, there was nothing in his face or dress or bearing to
      indicate that he felt himself to be a day older than his companion. He was
      a slender man, with a thin, serious face, cold gray eyes, and a trim drab
      mustache. Under his creaseless overcoat he wore neat gray clothes, of
      uniform pattern and strictly commercial aspect. He spoke with a quiet
      abruptness of speech as a rule, and both his rare smiles and his
      occasional simulations of vivacity were rather obviously artificial.
      Meeting Mr. Schuyler Tenney for even the first time, and looking him over,
      you would not, it is true, have been surprised to hear that he had just
      planted a dubious gold mine on the confiding English capitalists, or made
      a million dollars out of a three-jointed collar-button, or calmly cut out
      and carried off a railroad from under the very guns of the Stock Exchange.
      If his appearance did not suggest great exploits of this kind, it did not
      deny them once they were hinted by others. But the chance statement that
      he had privately helped somebody at his own cost without hope of reward
      would have given you a distinct shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present moment, Mr. Tenney was publicly known as one of the
      smartest and most &ldquo;go-ahead&rdquo; young business men of Thessaly. Dim rumors
      were upon the air that he was really something more than this; but as the
      commercial agencies had long ago given him their feeble &ldquo;A 1&rdquo; of
      superlative rating, and nothing definite was known about his outside
      investments, these reports only added vaguely to his respectability. He
      was the visible and actual head of the large wholesale hardware house of
      &ldquo;S. Tenney &amp; Co.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This establishment had before the war borne another name on the big sign
      over its portals, that of &ldquo;Sylvanus Boyce.&rdquo; A year or two after the war
      closed a new legend&mdash;&ldquo;Boyce &amp; Co.&rdquo;&mdash;was painted in. Thus it
      remained until the panic of 1873, when it underwent a transformation into
      &ldquo;Boyce &amp; Tenney.&rdquo; And now for some years the name of Boyce had
      disappeared altogether, and the portly, redfaced, dignified General had
      dwindled more and more into a position somewhere between the head
      book-keeper and the shipping-clerks. He was still a member of the firm,
      however, and it was apparently about this fact that Mr. Tenney had come to
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a seat beside Horace&rsquo;s desk, after shaking hands coldly with the
      young man, and said without ceremony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a chance before to see you alone. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to talk
      over at the store&mdash;your father&rsquo;s in and out all the while, more out
      than in, by the way&mdash;and Tracy&rsquo;s been here every day since you joined
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of town to-day,&rdquo; remarked Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I heard. That&rsquo;s why I came over. Do you know that your father has
      overdrawn his income account by nearly eleven thousand dollars, and that
      the wrong side of his book hasn&rsquo;t got room for more than another year or
      so of that sort of thing? In fact, it wouldn&rsquo;t last that long if I wanted
      to be sharp with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken very calmly, but they took the color as by a flash
      from Horace&rsquo;s face. He swung his chair round, and, looking Tenney in the
      eyes, seemed spell-bound by what he saw there. The gaze was sustained
      between the two men until it grew to be like the experiment of two
      school-children who try to stare each other down, and under its strain the
      young lawyer felt himself putting forth more and more exertion to hold his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I would tell you,&rdquo; added the hardware merchant, settling
      himself back in the chair and crossing his thin legs, and seemingly
      finding it no effort to continue looking his companion out of countenance.
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought you ought to know. I suppose he hasn&rsquo;t said anything to
      you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; answered Horace, shifting his glance to the desk before him,
      and striving with all his might to get his wits under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like him. The last thing he ever wants to talk about is business,
      least of all his own. They tell a story about a man who used to say,
      &lsquo;Thank God, that&rsquo;s settled!&rsquo; whenever he got a note renewed. He must have
      been a relation of the General&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sheridan that that&rsquo;s ascribed to,&rdquo; said Horace, for the sake of
      saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, &lsquo;Little Phil&rsquo;? I thought he had more sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in this display of ignorance which gave Horace the
      courage to face his visitor once more. He turned resolutely toward Tenney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows better than you do,&rdquo; he said, finding increased self-control
      with every word, now that the first excitement was over, &ldquo;that a great
      deal of money has been made in that firm of yours. I shall be glad to
      investigate the conditions under which the business has contrived to make
      you rich and your partner poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney seemed disagreeably surprised at this tone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk
      nonsense,&rdquo; he said with passing asperity. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re welcome. The
      books are open to you. If a man makes four thousand dollars and spends
      seven thousand dollars, what on earth has his partner&rsquo;s affairs to do with
      it? I live within my income and attend to my business, and he doesn&rsquo;t do
      either. That&rsquo;s the long and short of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men talked together on this subject for a considerable time,
      Horace alternating between expressions of indignation at the fact that his
      father had become the unedifying tail of a concern of which he once was
      everything, and more or less ingenious efforts to discover what way out of
      the difficulty, if any, was offered. Mr. Tenney remained unmoved under
      both, and at last coolly quitted the topic altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to do well here,&rdquo; he said, ignoring a point-blank question
      about how General Boyce&rsquo;s remaining interest could be protected.
      &ldquo;Thessaly&rsquo;s going to have a regular boom before long. You&rsquo;ll see this
      place a city in another year or two. We&rsquo;ve got population enough now, for
      that matter, only it&rsquo;s spread out so. How did you come to go in with
      Tracy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? He&rsquo;s the best man here, and starting alone is the
      slowest kind of slow work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney smiled a little, and put the tips of his fingers together
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tracy and I don&rsquo;t hitch very well, you know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I took a
      downright fancy to him when I first came in from Sidon Hill, but he&rsquo;s such
      a curious, touchy sort of fellow. I asked him one day what church he&rsquo;d
      recommend me to join; of course I was a stranger, and explained to him
      that what I wanted was not to make any mistake, but to get into the church
      where there were the most respectable people who would be of use to me;
      and what do you think he said? He was huffed about it&mdash;actually mad!
      He said he&rsquo;d rather have given me a hundred dollars than had me ask him
      that question; and after that he was cool, and so was I, and we&rsquo;ve never
      had much to say to each other since then. Of course, there&rsquo;s no quarrel,
      you know. Only it strikes me he&rsquo;ll be a queer sort of man to get along
      with. A lawyer with cranks like that&mdash;why, you never know what he&rsquo;ll
      do next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of the best fellows alive,&rdquo; said Horace, with sharp emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course he is,&rdquo; replied Mr. Tenney. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t business. Take
      the General, for instance; he&rsquo;s a good fellow, too&mdash;in a different
      kind of way, of course&mdash;and see where it&rsquo;s landed him. The best
      fellow is No. 1. Look out for him and you are all right. Tracy might be
      making five or six times as much as he is, if he went the right way to
      work. He does more business and gets less for it than any other lawyer in
      town. There&rsquo;s no sense in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Mr. Tenney,&rdquo; said Horace, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, in which
      he deliberately framed what he was going to say, &ldquo;I find it difficult to
      understand why you thought it worth while to come here at all to-day: it
      surely wasn&rsquo;t to talk about Tracy; and the things I want to know about my
      father you won&rsquo;t discuss. What <i>do</i> you want, anyway? Wait a moment,
      let me finish. What I see is this: that you were a private in the regiment
      my father was colonel of; that he made you a sort of adjutant, or
      something in the nature of a clerk, and so lifted you out of the ranks;
      that during the war, when your health failed, he gave you a place in his
      business here at home, which lifted you out of the farm; that a while
      later he made you a partner; and that gradually the tables have been
      completely turned, until you are the colonel and he is the private, you
      are rich and he is nearly insolvent. That is what the thing sums up to in
      my mind. What is <i>your</i> view of it? He was good to you. Have you come
      to tell me that now you are going to be good to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Haven&rsquo;t I been good to him?&rdquo; said Tenney, with real
      indignation. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I have frozen him out eighteen months ago instead
      of taking up his overdrafts at only ten per cent, charge so as to keep him
      along? There isn&rsquo;t one man in a hundred who would have done for him what I
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the proportion was much larger, I am afraid this would be a very
      unhappy world to live in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney eyed the lawyer doubtfully. He had not clearly grasped the
      meaning of this remark, but instinct told him that it was hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! You may take it that way, if you like.&rdquo; He rose as he spoke
      and began buttoning his overcoat. &ldquo;Only let me say this: when the smash
      comes, you can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you. If you won&rsquo;t listen to me, that&rsquo;s
      <i>your</i> lookout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t done anything but listen to you for the last two hours,&rdquo;
       said Horace, who longed to tell his visitor to go to the devil, and yet
      was betrayed into signs of anxiety at the prospect of his departure. &ldquo;If
      you&rsquo;ll remember, you haven&rsquo;t told me anything that I asked for. Heaven
      knows, I should be only too glad to listen, if you&rsquo;ve got anything to
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney made a smiling movement with his thin lips and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would change your tune,&rdquo; he said, calmly. Horace offered a
      gesture of dissent, to which the hardware merchant paid no attention. He
      had measured his man, and decided upon a system of treatment. &ldquo;What I
      really wanted,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;was to look you over and hear you talk, and
      kind of walk around you and size you up, so to speak. You see I&rsquo;ve only
      known you as a youngster&mdash;better at spending money than at making it.
      Now that you&rsquo;ve started as a lawyer, I thought I&rsquo;d take stock of you
      again, don&rsquo;t you see; and the best way to sound you all around was to talk
      about your father&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace was conscious of a temptation to be angry at this cool statement,
      but he did not yield to it. &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t true&mdash;what you have told
      me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, it is, mostly,&rdquo; answered Mr. Tenney, again contemplating his
      joined finger-tips. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t of so much importance compared with some
      other things. There&rsquo;s bigger game afoot than partnerships in hardware
      stores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace gave a little laugh of mingled irritation and curiosity. &ldquo;What the
      devil <i>are</i> you driving at, Tenney?&rdquo; he said, and swung his chair
      once more to face his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the two men eyed each other more sympathetically, and the tones
      of the two voices lost something of their previous reserve. Mr. Tenney
      himself resumed the conversation with an air of direct candor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard somebody say you rather counted on getting some of the Minster
      iron-works business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fact is, I may have said I hoped to, but nothing definite has
      been settled. The ladies are friends of mine: we came up from New York
      together last month; but nothing was decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Tenney, and Horace felt uneasily, as he looked into
      those sharp gray eyes, that no doubt they did see very clearly. &ldquo;You were
      just gassing. I thought as much. There&rsquo;s no harm in that, only it&rsquo;s no
      good to gas with me, for there&rsquo;s some solid business to be done&mdash;something
      mighty promising for both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve no notion what you mean,&rdquo; said Horace. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s just as
      well to clear up the ground as we go along. The first experiment of yoking
      up Boyces and Tenneys together hasn&rsquo;t turned out so admirably as to
      warrant me&mdash;What shall I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to warrant you going in with your eyes shut.&rdquo; Mr. Tenney supplied the
      lacking phrase with evident enjoyment. &ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Boyce. On the
      contrary, what I want of you is to have your eyes peeled particularly wide
      open. But, first of all, Tracy mustn&rsquo;t hear a breath of this whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go no further, I beg of you. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t touch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you will,&rdquo; said Mr. Tenney, briskly and with confidence. &ldquo;He has
      his own private business. Why shouldn&rsquo;t you? The railroad work, for
      example: you don&rsquo;t share in that. That is his own, and quite right, too.
      But that very fact leaves you free, doesn&rsquo;t it, to go into speculations on
      your own account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speculations&mdash;yes, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No &lsquo;perhaps&rsquo; about it; of course it does. At least, you can hear what I
      have to say without telling him, whether you go into the thing or not; do
      you promise me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I wish to promise anything,&rdquo; said Horace, doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! If you won&rsquo;t deal, you won&rsquo;t; and I must protect myself my own
      way.&rdquo; Mr. Tenney did not rise and again begin buttoning his coat, nor was
      it, indeed, necessary. There had been menace enough in his tone to effect
      his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; answered Horace, in a low voice; &ldquo;if you insist, I
      promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall know within half an hour if you do tell him,&rdquo; said Mr. Tenney, in
      his most affable manner; &ldquo;but of course you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped Horace, testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. So far, so good. The first thing, then, is to put the
      affairs of the Minster women into your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace took his feet off the table, and looked in fixed surprise at his
      father&rsquo;s partner. &ldquo;How&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; he stammered at last,
      realizing, even as he spoke, that there were certain strange depths in Mr.
      Tenney&rsquo;s eyes which had been dimly apparent at the outset, and then had
      been for a long time veiled, and were now once more discernible. &ldquo;How do
      you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be fixed, as easy as rolling off a log. Old Clarke has gone to
      Florida for his health, and there&rsquo;s going to be a change made. A word from
      me can turn the whole thing over to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word from you!&rdquo; Horace spoke with incredulity, but he did not really
      doubt. There was a revelation of reserve power in the man&rsquo;s glance that
      fascinated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said. The question is whether I shall speak it or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be frank with you&rdquo;&mdash;Horace smiled a little&mdash;&ldquo;I hope very
      much that you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay. But have you got the nerve for it?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the point. Can
      you keep your mouth shut, and your head clear, and will you follow me
      without kicking or blabbing? That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just what I can&rsquo;t tell you. I&rsquo;m not going to bind myself to do
      unknown things.&rdquo; Horace said this bravely enough, but the shrewd,
      listening ear understood very well the lurking accent of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t bind yourself to anything, except to tell Tracy nothing till
      I give you the word, and then only what we shall agree upon. Of course,
      later on he will have to know something about it. But leave that to me.
      And mind, mum&rsquo;s the word.&rdquo; Mr. Tenney rose now, not tentatively, but as
      one who is really going. Horace sprang to his feet as well, and despite
      the other&rsquo;s declaration that he was pressed for time, and had already
      stayed too long, insisted on detaining him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t understand in all this,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;for that
      matter the whole thing is a mystery&mdash;but what I particularly fail to
      see is your object in benefiting me. The two things don&rsquo;t hitch. You tell
      me that you have got my father in a hole, and then you offer me a great
      and substantial prize. I don&rsquo;t catch the sequence. You are not the man to
      do things for nothing. What you haven&rsquo;t told me is what there is in this
      affair for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney seemed complimented by this tribute to his commercial sense and
      single-mindedness. &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t told you,&rdquo; he said, buttoning his coat.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll come in due time. All you&rsquo;ve got to do meanwhile is to keep
      still, and to take the thing when it comes to you. Let me know at once,
      and say nothing to any living soul&mdash;least of all Tracy&mdash;until
      you&rsquo;ve talked with me. That oughtn&rsquo;t to be hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I don&rsquo;t like the conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may lump them,&rdquo; said Schuyler Ten, ney, disclosing his small
      teeth again in a half-smile, as he made his way out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;MRS. MINSTER&rsquo;S NEW LEGAL ADVISER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome two weeks
      later Mr. Horace Boyce, on returning home one evening, found on his table
      a note which had been delivered during the day by a servant. It was from
      Mrs. Minster&mdash;&ldquo;Desideria Minster&rdquo; she signed herself&mdash;asking him
      to call upon her the following afternoon. The young man read the missive
      over and over again by the lamplight, and if it had been a love-letter
      from the daughter instead of the polite business appointment by the
      mother, his eyes couldn&rsquo;t have flashed more eagerly as he took in the
      meaning of its words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meaning of its words! He thought long upon that, ruminating in his
      easy-chair before the fire until far past midnight, until the dainty
      little Japanese saucer at his side was heaped up with cigar ashes, and the
      air was heavy with smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently this summons was directly connected with the remarks made by
      Tenney a fortnight before. He had said the Minster business should come to
      him, and here it was. The fact that Mrs. Minster wrote to him at his
      residence, rather than at his office, was proof that she too wished to
      have him alone, and not the firm of Tracy &amp; Boyce, as her adviser.
      That there should be this prejudice against Reuben, momentarily disturbed
      the young man; but, upon examination, he found it easy to account for it.
      Reuben was very nice&mdash;his partner even paused for a moment to reflect
      how decent a fellow Reuben really was&mdash;but then, he scarcely belonged
      to the class of society in which people like the Boyces and Minsters
      moved. Naturally the millionnaire widow, belonging as she did to an
      ancient family in the Hudson River valley, and bearing the queer name of a
      grandmother who had been a colonial beauty, would prefer to have as her
      family lawyer somebody who also had ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation had its notable social side, too. There was no good in
      blinking the fact that his father the General&mdash;who had effected a
      somewhat noisy entrance to the house a half-hour ago, and the sound of
      whose burdened breathing now intermittently came to his ears in the
      silence of the night&mdash;had allowed the family status to lapse. The
      Boyces were not what they had been. In the course of such few calls as he
      had made since his return, it had been impossible for him not to detect
      the existence of a certain surprise that he should have called at all.
      Everybody, too, had taken pains to avoid reference to his father, even
      when the course of talk made such allusion natural. This had for the
      moment angered the young man, and later had not a little discouraged him.
      As a boy he had felt it a great thing to be the son of a general, and to
      find it now to be a distinct detriment was disheartening indeed. But this
      black-bordered, perfumed note from Mrs. Minster put all, as by the sweep
      of a hand, into the background. Once he visited that proud household as a
      friend, once he looked Thessaly in the face as the confidential adviser of
      the Minster family, the Boyces were rehabilitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dwell upon the thought was very pleasant, for it led the way by sweetly
      vagrant paths to dreams of the dark-eyed, beautiful Kate. During the past
      month these visions had lost color and form under the disconcerting
      influences just spoken of, but now they became, as if by magic, all
      rosy-hued and definite again. He had planned to himself on that first
      November day a career which should be crowned by marriage with the lovely
      daughter of the millions, and had made a mental march around the walls
      encompassing her to spy out their least defended point. Now, all at once,
      marvellous as it seemed, he found himself transported within the
      battlements. He was to be her mother&rsquo;s lawyer&mdash;nay, <i>her</i> lawyer
      as well, and to his sanguine fancy this meant everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything? The word seemed feeble. It meant one of the most beautiful
      women he had ever seen as his wife&mdash;a lady well-born, delicately
      nurtured, clever, and good; it meant vast wealth, untold wealth, with
      which to be not only the principal personage of these provincial parts,
      but a great figure in New York or Washington or Europe. He might be
      senator in Congress, minister to Paris, or even aspire to the towering,
      solitary eminence of the Presidency itself with the backing of these
      millions. It meant a yacht, the very dream of sea-going luxury and speed,
      in which to bask under Hawaiian skies, to loiter lazily along the topaz
      shores of far Cathay, to flit to and fro between spice lands and cold
      northern seas, the whole watery globe subject to her keel. Why, there
      could be a castle on the Moselle, a country house in Devonshire, a flat in
      Paris, a villa at Mentone, a summer island home on the St. Lawrence, a
      mansion in New York&mdash;all together, if he liked, or as many as pleased
      his whim. It might be worth the while to lease a shooting in Scotland,
      only the mischief was that badly bred Americans, the odious <i>nouveaux
      riches</i>, had rather discredited the national name in the Highlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the young man&rsquo;s fancies floated on the wreaths of scented smoke till at
      last he yawned in spite of himself, sated with the contemplation of the
      gifts the gods had brought him. He read Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s note once again
      before he went to bed, and sleep overtook his brain while it was still
      pleasantly musing on the choicest methods of expending the income of her
      millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, during all these hours of happy castle-building, the
      question of why Schuyler Tenney had interested himself in the young man&rsquo;s
      fortunes never once crossed that young man&rsquo;s mind. To be frank, the
      pictures he painted were all of &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; and &ldquo;ladies,&rdquo; and his father&rsquo;s
      partner, though his help might be of great assistance at the outset, could
      scarcely expect to mingle in such company, even in Horace&rsquo;s tobacco
      reveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither to his father at the breakfast-table, nor to Reuben Tracy at the
      office, did young Mr. Boyce next day mention the fact that he was to call
      on Mrs. Minster. This enforced silence was not much to his liking,
      primarily because his temperament was the reverse of secretive. When he
      had done anything or thought of doing something, the impulse to tell about
      it was always strong upon him. The fact that the desire to talk was not
      rigorously balanced by regard for the exact and prosaic truth may not have
      been an essential part of the trait when we come to analysis, but
      garrulity and exaggeration ran together in Horace&rsquo;s nature. To repress
      them now, just at the time when the most important event of his life
      impended, required a good deal of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some qualms of conscience, too, so far as Reuben was concerned. Two
      or three things had happened within the past week which had laid him under
      special obligation to the courtesy and good feeling of his partner. They
      were not important, perhaps, but still the memory of them weighed upon <i>his</i>
      mind when, at three o&rsquo;clock, he put on his coat and explained that he
      might not be back again that afternoon. Reuben nodded, and said, &ldquo;All
      right: I shall be here. If so-and-so comes, I&rsquo;ll go over the matter and
      make notes for you.&rdquo; Then Horace longed very much to tell all about the
      Minster summons and the rest, and this longing arose as much from a wish
      to be frank and fair as from a craving to confide his secret to somebody;
      but he only hesitated for a second, and then went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster received him in the chamber which had been her husband&rsquo;s
      working room, and which still contained his desk, although it had since
      been furnished with book-shelves and was called the library. Horace noted,
      as the widow rose to greet him, that, though the desk was open, its
      pigeon-holes did not seem to contain many papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his hostess had bidden him to be seated, and had spoken in mildly
      deprecating tones about the weather, she closed her resolutely lined lips,
      folded her hands in her lap, and looked at him in amiable suspense. As has
      been said before, Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s dark face, with its high frame of white
      hair and its bright black eyes, habitually produced an impression of great
      cleverness and alert insight, and Horace was conscious of embarrassment in
      finding the task of conversation devolved upon himself. He took up the
      burden, however, and carried it along from subject to subject until at
      last it seemed fitting to broach the great topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get your note until evening,&rdquo; he said, with a polite inquiring
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t send it until after dinner,&rdquo; she replied, and a pause
      ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fortunately occurred to Horace to say he was very glad to have her call
      upon him always, if in any way she saw how he could serve her. As he spoke
      these words, he felt that they were discreet and noncommittal, and yet
      must force her to come to the point. And they did, after a fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said, graciously, and came to a
      full stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is anything I can do now,&rdquo; Horace remarked tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;oh yes! What I wanted to ask you was, do you know the
      Wendovers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I do.&rdquo; murmured the young man, with a great sinking of the
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re New York people,&rdquo; the lady explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know almost nobody in New York,&rdquo; answered Horace gloomily. &ldquo;Wendover?
      No, I am quite sure the name is new to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is curious,&rdquo; said Mrs. Minster. She took a letter up from the desk.
      &ldquo;This is from Judge Wendover, and it mentions you. I gathered from it that
      he knew you quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, shades of the lies that might have been told, if one had only known!
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace swiftly ransacked his brain for a way out of this dilemma.
      Evidently this letter bore upon his selection as her lawyer. He guessed
      rightly that it had been written at Tenney&rsquo;s suggestion and by some one
      who had Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s confidence. Obviously this some one was of the
      legal profession. That was his cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name does sound familiar, on second thought,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I daresay it
      is, if I could only place it. You see, I had a number of offers to enter
      legal firms in New York, and in that way I saw a good many people for a
      few minutes, you know, and quite probably I&rsquo;ve forgotten some of their
      names. They would remember me, of course, but I might confuse them one
      with another, don&rsquo;t you see? Strange, I don&rsquo;t fix the man you mean. Was he
      a middle-aged man, grayish hair, well dressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that describes him.&rdquo; She did not add that it would equally describe
      seven out of every ten other men called &ldquo;judge&rdquo; throughout the United
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I place him,&rdquo; said Horace triumphantly. &ldquo;There was some talk of my
      going into his office as a junior partner. Mutual friends of ours proposed
      it, I remember. But it didn&rsquo;t attract me. Curious that I should have
      forgotten his name. One&rsquo;s memory plays such whimsical tricks, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Judge Wendover was practising law,&rdquo; said Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;He
      never was much of a lawyer. He was county judge once down in Peekskill,
      about the time I was married, but he didn&rsquo;t get reelected; and I thought
      he gave it all up when he went to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the man I mean,&rdquo; put in Horace, groping his way despairingly,
      &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t much business in his office. That is why I didn&rsquo;t go in, I
      daresay: it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth my while unless he himself was devoted to
      the law, and carried on a big practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s the same man,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;He probably <i>would</i>
      have a kind of law office. They generally do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, may I ask,&rdquo; Horace ventured after another pause, &ldquo;in what
      connection he mentions my name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He recommends me to consult you about affairs&mdash;to&mdash;well, how
      shall I say it?&mdash;to make you my lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eureka! The words were out, and the difficult passage about Judge
      What&rsquo;s-his-name was left safely behind. Horace felt his brain swimming on
      a sea of exaltation, but he kept his face immobile, and bowed his head
      with gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very young for so serious a responsibility, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said
      modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow reassured him with a smile. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t really much to do,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;And somebody would have to learn what there is; and you can do
      that as well as any one else, better than a stranger. The difficulty is,&rdquo;
       she spoke more slowly, and Horace listened with all his ears: &ldquo;you have a
      partner, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man did not hesitate for an instant. &ldquo;Only in a limited way,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;Mr. Tracy and I have combined on certain lines of work where two
      heads are better than one, but we each keep distinct our own private
      practice. It is much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly prefer it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;I am glad to hear you keep
      separate. I do not know Mr. Tracy, and, indeed, he is very highly spoken
      of as a <i>lawyer</i>; but certain things I have heard&mdash;social
      matters, I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady broke off discreetly. She could not tell this young man what she
      had heard about that visit to the Lawton house. Horace listened to her
      without the remotest notion of her meaning, and so could only smile
      faintly and give the least suggestion of a sigh. Clearly he must throw
      Reuben overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have everything in this world just to our minds,&rdquo; he said
      judicially, and it seemed to him to cover the case with prudent vagueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you thought the partnership would be a good thing?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the time&mdash;<i>yes</i>,&rdquo; answered Horace. &ldquo;And, to be fair, it
      really has some advantages. Mr. Tracy is a prodigious worker, for one
      thing, and he is very even-tempered and willing; so that the burden of
      details is taken off my shoulders to a great extent, and that disposes one
      to overlook a good many things, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster nodded appreciation. She also knew what it was to delight in
      relief from the burden of details, and she said to herself that
      fortunately Mr. Boyce would thus have the more leisure to devote the
      affairs of the Minsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into their further talk it is not needful to pursue the lady and her
      lawyer. She spoke only in general terms, outlining her interests and
      investments which required attention, and vaguely defining what she
      expected him to do. Horace listened very closely, but beyond a nebulous
      comprehension of the existence of a big company and a little company,
      which together controlled the iron-works and its appurtenances, he learned
      next to nothing. One of the first things which she desired of Horace was,
      however, that he should go to Florida and talk the whole subject over with
      Mr. Clarke, and to this he gladly assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write to him that you are coming,&rdquo; she said, as she rose. &ldquo;I may
      tell you that he personally preferred Mr. Tracy as his successor; but, as
      I have told you&mdash;well, there were reasons why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace made haste to bow and say &ldquo;quite so,&rdquo; and thus spare Mrs. Minster
      the trouble of explanations. &ldquo;Perhaps it will be better to say nothing to
      any one until I have returned from Florida,&rdquo; he added, as a parting
      suggestion, and it had her assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man walked buoyantly down the gravel path and along the streets,
      his veins fairly tingling with excitement and joy. The great prize had
      come to him&mdash;wealth, honor, fame, were all within his grasp. He
      thought proudly, as he strode along, of what he would do after his
      marriage. Even the idea of hyphenating the two names in the English
      fashion, Minster-Boyce, came into his mind, and was made welcome. Perhaps,
      though, it couldn&rsquo;t well be done until his father was dead; and that
      reminded him&mdash;he really must speak to the General about his loose
      behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Horace exultantly communed with his happy self, and formed
      resolutions, dreamed dreams, discussed radiant probabilities as he walked,
      until his abstracted eye was suddenly, insensibly arrested by the sight of
      a familiar sign across the street&mdash;&ldquo;S. Tenney &amp; Co.&rdquo; Then for the
      first time he remembered his promise, and the air grew colder about him as
      he recalled it. He crossed the road after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and
      entered the hardware store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney was alone in the little office partitioned off by wood and
      glass from the open store. He received the account given by Horace of his
      visit to the Minster mansion with no indication of surprise, and with no
      outward sign of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, so good,&rdquo; he said, briefly. Then, after a moment&rsquo;s meditation, he
      looked up sharply in the face of the young man, who was still standing:
      &ldquo;Did you say anything about your terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. How could I? You don&rsquo;t show price-lists like a
      storekeeper, in the <i>law!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney smiled just a little at Horace&rsquo;s haughty tone&mdash;a smile of
      furtive amusement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk with you about
      that later. The old lady&rsquo;s rather close-fisted. We may make a point there&mdash;by
      sending in bills much smaller than old Clarke&rsquo;s used to be. I ought to
      have told you about that. Luckily it wasn&rsquo;t needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matter-of-fact way in which Mr. Tenney used this &ldquo;we&rdquo; grated
      disagreeably on the young man&rsquo;s ear, suggesting as it did a new
      partnership uncomfortably vague in form; but he deemed it wise not to
      touch upon the subject. His next question, as to the identity of Judge
      Wendover, brought upon the stage, however, still a third partner in the
      shadowy firm to which he had committed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Wendover&rsquo;s in with us. He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied Schuyler Tenney,
      lightly. &ldquo;Never heard of him, eh? He&rsquo;s the president of the Thessaly
      Manufacturing Company. You&rsquo;ll hear a good deal about <i>that</i> later
      on.&rdquo; The speaker showed his teeth again by a smiling movement of the lips
      at this assurance, and Horace somehow felt his uneasiness growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants me to go to Florida to see Clarke, and talk things over,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. That&rsquo;s important. We must consider all that very carefully
      before you go. Clarke requires handling. Leave that to me. I&rsquo;ll think out
      what you are to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace was momentarily shrinking in importance before his own mental
      vision; and, though he resented it, he could not but submit. &ldquo;I suppose
      I&rsquo;d better make some other excuse to Tracy about the Florida trip,&rdquo; he
      said, almost deferentially; &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you think so, do you?&rdquo; Mr. Tenney was interested, and made a renewed
      scrutiny of the young man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Perhaps. I&rsquo;ll think about it, and let
      you know to-morrow. Look in about this time, and don&rsquo;t say anything till
      then. So long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus dismissed, Horace took his leave, and it was not until he had nearly
      reached his home that the thoughts chasing each other in his mind began to
      take on once more roseate hues and hopeful outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney watched his partner&rsquo;s son through the partition until he was
      out of sight, and then smiled at the papers on his desk in confidence.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ready to lie at a minute&rsquo;s notice,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;offered on his own
      hook to lie to Tracy. That&rsquo;s all right&mdash;only he mustn&rsquo;t try it on
      with me!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;THE THESSALY CITIZENS&rsquo; CLUB.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he village of
      Thessaly took no pains to conceal the fact that it was very proud of
      itself. What is perhaps more unique is that the farming people round
      about, and even the smaller and rival hamlets scattered through the
      section, cordially recognized Thessaly&rsquo;s right to be proud, and had a
      certain satisfaction in themselves sharing that pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lest this should breed misconception and paint a more halcyon picture of
      these minor communities than is deserved, let it be explained that they
      were not without their vehement jealousies and bickerings among one
      another. Often there arose between them sore contentions over questions of
      tax equalization and over political neglects and intrigues; and here, too,
      there existed, in generous measure, those queer parochial prejudices&mdash;based
      upon no question whatever, and defying alike inquiry and explanation&mdash;which
      are so curious a heritage from the childhood days of the race. No
      long-toed brachycephalous cave-dweller of the stone age could have
      disliked the stranger who hibernated in the holes on the other side of the
      river more heartily than the people of Octavius disliked those of Sidon.
      In the hop-picking season the young men of these two townships always fell
      to fighting when they met, and their pitched conflicts in and around the
      Half-way House near Tyre, when dances were given there in the winter, were
      things to talk about straight through until hoeing had begun in the
      spring. There were many other of these odd and inexplicable aversions&mdash;as,
      for instance, that which had for many years impelled every farmer along
      the whole length of the Nedahma Creek road to vote against any and all
      candidates nominated from Juno Mills, a place which they scarcely knew and
      had no earthly reason for disliking. But in such cases no one asked for
      reasons. Matters simply stood that way, and there was nothing more to be
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But everybody was proud of Thessaly. Neighbors took almost as much
      pleasure in boasting of its wealth and activity, and prophesying its
      future greatness, as did its own sons. The farmers when they came in gazed
      with gratified amazement at the new warehouses, the new chimneys, the new
      factory walls that were rising everywhere about them, and returned more
      satisfied than ever that &ldquo;Thessaly was just a-humming along.&rdquo; Dearborn
      County had always heretofore been a strictly agricultural district, full
      of rich farm-lands and well-to-do farm-owners, and celebrated in the
      markets of New York for the excellence of its dairy products. Now it
      seemed certain that Thessaly would soon be a city, and it was already a
      subject for congratulation that the industries which were rooting,
      sprouting, or bearing fruit there had given Dearborn County a place among
      the dozen foremost manufacturing shires in the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmers were as pleased over this as any one else. It was true that
      they were growing poorer year by year; that their lands were gradually
      becoming covered with a parchment film of mortgages, more deadly than
      sorrel or the dreaded black-moss; that the prices of produce had gone down
      on the one hand as much as the cost of living and of labor had risen on
      the other; that a rich farmer had become a rarity in a district which once
      was controlled by the princes of herds and waving fields: but all the same
      the agriculturists of Dearborn County were proud of Thessaly, of its
      crowds of foreign-born operatives, its smoke-capped chimneys, and its
      noisy bustle. They marched almost solidly to the polls to vote for the
      laws which were supposed to protect its industries, and they consoled
      themselves for falling incomes and increased expenditure by roseate
      pictures of the great &ldquo;home market&rdquo; which Thessaly was to create for them
      when it became a city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village had once been very slow indeed. For many years it had been
      scarcely known to the outside world save as the seat of a seminary of
      something more than local repute. This institution still nestled under the
      brow of the hill whence the boy Reuben Tracy had looked with fondly
      wistful vision down upon it, but it was no longer of much importance. It
      was yet possible to discern in the quiet streets immediately adjoining the
      seminary enclosure, with their tall arched canopies of elm-boughs, and
      old-fashioned white houses with verandas and antique gardens, some remains
      of the academic character that this institution had formerly imparted to
      the whole village. But the centre of activity and of population had long
      since moved southward, and around this had grown up a new Thessaly, which
      needed neither elms nor gardens, which had use for its children at the
      loom or the lathe when the rudiments of the common school were finished,
      and which alike in its hours of toil and of leisure was anything rather
      than academie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that in this modern Thessaly, with its factories and mills, its
      semi-foreign saloons, and its long streets of uniformly ugly cottage
      dwellings, there were many hundreds of adults who had no idea whether the
      once-famous Thessaly seminary was still open or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Thessaly had had the time and inclination for a serious study of
      itself, this decadence of the object of its former pride might have
      awakened some regret. The seminary, which had been one of the first in the
      land to open its doors to both sexes, had borne an honorable part in the
      great agitation against slavery that preceded the war. Some of its
      professors had been distinguished abolitionists&mdash;of the kind who
      strove, suffered, and made sacrifices when the cause was still unpopular,
      yet somehow fell or were edged out of public view once the cause had
      triumphed and there were rewards to be distributed, and they had taken the
      sentiment of the village with them in those old days. Then there was a
      steady demand upon the seminary library, which was open to householders of
      the village, for good books. Then there was maintained each winter a
      lecture course, which was able, not so much by money as by the weight and
      character of its habitual patrons, to enrich its annual lists with such
      names as Emerson, Burritt, Phillips, Curtis, and Beecher. At this time had
      occurred the most sensational episode in the history of the village&mdash;when
      the rumor spread that a runaway negro was secreted somewhere about the
      seminary buildings, and a pro-slavery crowd came over from Tyre to have
      him out and to vindicate upon the persons of his protectors the outraged
      majesty of the Fugitive Slave law, and the citizens of Thessaly rose and
      chased back the invaders with celerity and emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this had happened so long ago that it was only vaguely remembered
      now. There were those who still liked to recall those days and to tell
      stories about them, but they had only themselves for listeners. The new
      Thessaly was not precisely intolerant of the history of this ante-bellum
      period, but it had fresher and more important matters to think of; and its
      customary comment upon these legends of the slow, one-horse past was,
      &ldquo;Things have changed a good deal since then,&rdquo; offered with a smile of
      distinct satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, things had changed. Stephen Minster&rsquo;s enterprise in opening up the
      iron fields out at Juno, and in building the big smelting-works on the
      outskirts of Thessaly, had altered everything. The branch road to the coal
      district which he called into existence lifted the village at once into
      prominence as a manufacturing site. Other factories were erected for the
      making of buttons, shoes, Scotch-caps, pasteboard boxes, matches, and a
      number of varieties of cotton cloths. When this last industry appeared in
      the midst of them, the people of Thessaly found their heads fairly turned.
      To be lords of iron and cotton both!
    </p>
    <p>
      This period of industrial progress, of which I speak with, I hope,
      becoming respect and pride, had now lasted some dozen years, and, so far
      from showing signs of interruption, there were under discussion four or
      five new projects for additional trades to be started in the village,
      which would be decided upon by the time the snow was off the ground.
      During these years, Thessaly had more than quadrupled its population,
      which was now supposed to approximate thirteen thousand, and might be even
      more. There had been considerable talk for the past year or two about
      getting a charter as a city from the legislature, and undoubtedly this
      would soon be done. About this step there were, however, certain
      difficulties, more clearly felt than expressed. Not even those who were
      most exultant over Thessaly&rsquo;s splendid advance in wealth and activity were
      blind to sundry facts written on the other side of the ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thessaly had now some two thousand voters, of whom perhaps two-fifths had
      been born in Europe. It had a saloon for every three hundred and fifty
      inhabitants, and there was an uneasy sense of connection between these two
      facts which gave rise to awkward thoughts. The village was fairly well
      managed by its trustees; the electorate insisted upon nothing save that
      they should grant licenses liberally, and, this apart, their government
      did not leave much to be desired. But how would it be when the municipal
      honors were taken on, when mayor, aider-men and all the other officers of
      the new city, with enlarged powers of expenditure and legislation, should
      be voted for? Whenever the responsible business men of Thessaly allowed
      their minds to dwell upon a forecast of what this board of aldermen would
      probably be like, they frankly owned to themselves that the prospect was
      not inviting. But as a rule they did not say so, and the village was
      drifting citywards on a flowing tide.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just before Christmas that Reuben Tracy took the first step toward
      realizing his dream of making this Thessaly a better place than it was.
      Fourteen citizens, all more or less intimate friends of his, assembled at
      his office one evening, and devoted some hours to listening to and
      discussing his plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      An embarrassment arose almost at the outset through the discovery that
      five or six of the men present thought Thessaly was getting on very well
      as it was, and had assumed that the meeting was called for the purpose of
      arranging a citizens&rsquo; movement to run the coming spring elections for
      trustees in the interest of good government&mdash;by which they of course
      understood that they were to be asked to take office. The exposure of this
      mistake threatened for a little time to wreck the purpose of the
      gathering. Mr. Jones, a gentleman who made matches, or rather had just
      taken a handsome sum from the great Ruby Loco-foco Trust as his reward for
      ceasing to manufacture them, was especially disposed to resent what Reuben
      said about the moral and material state of the village. He insisted that
      it was the busiest and most progressive town in that whole section of the
      State; it had six streets well paved, was lighted with gas, had no
      disorderly houses to speak of, and turned out an annual production of
      manufactures worth two and a half times as much as the industrial output
      of any other place of its size in the State. He had the figures at his
      tongue&rsquo;s end, and when he finished with a spirited sentence about being
      proud of his native town, and about birds fouling their own nests, it
      looked as if he had the sense of the little assemblage with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben Tracy found it somewhat difficult to reply to an unexpected attack
      of this nature. He was forced to admit the truth of everything his critic
      had said, and then to attempt once more to show why these things were not
      enough. Father Chance, the Catholic priest, a broad-shouldered, athletic
      young man, who preached very commonplace sermons but did an enormous
      amount of pastoral work, took up the speaking, and showed that his mind
      ran mainly upon the importance of promoting total abstinence. John
      Fairchild, the editor and owner of Thessaly&rsquo;s solitary daily paper, a
      candid and warmhearted man, whose heterodoxy on the tariff question gave
      concern to the business men of the place, but whose journal was honest and
      popular, next explained what his views were, and succeeded in
      precipitating, by some chance remark, a long, rambling, and irrelevant
      debate on the merits of protection and the proper relations between
      capital and labor. To illustrate his position on these subjects, and on
      the general question of Thessaly&rsquo;s condition, Mr. Burdick, the cashier of
      the Dearborn County Bank, next related how he was originally opposed to
      the Bland Silver bill, and detailed the mental processes by which his
      opinion had finally become reversed. The Rev. Dr. Turner, the rector of
      St. Matthew&rsquo;s, a mildly paternal gentleman, who seemed chiefly occupied by
      the thought that he was in the same room with a Catholic priest,
      tentatively suggested a bazaar, with ladies and the wives of workingmen
      mingled together on the committee, and smiled and coughed confusedly when
      this idea was received in absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Dr. Lester, a young physician who had moved into the village only a
      few years before, but was already its leading medical authority, who broke
      this silence by saying, with a glance which, slowly circling the room,
      finally rested on Reuben Tracy: &ldquo;All this does not help us. Our views on
      all sorts of matters are interesting, no doubt, but they are not vital
      just now. The question is not so much why you propose something, but what
      do you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer came before the person addressed had arranged his words, and it
      came from Horace Boyce. This young gentleman had, with a self-restraint
      which he himself was most surprised at, taken no part in the previous
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this is the idea,&rdquo; he said now, pulling his chair forward into
      the edge of the open space under the light, and speaking with easy
      distinctness and fluency. &ldquo;It will be time enough to determine just what
      we will do when we have put ourselves in the position to act together upon
      what we may decide to do. We are all proud and fond of our village; we are
      at one in our desire to serve and advance its interests. That is a
      platform broad enough, and yet specific enough, for us to start upon. Let
      us accept it as a beginning, and form an association, club, society&mdash;whatever
      it may be called&mdash;with this primary purpose in view: to get together
      in one body the gentlemen who represent what is most enlightened, most
      public-spirited, and at once most progressive and most conservative in
      Thessaly. All that we need at first is the skeleton of an organization,
      the most important feature of which would be the committee on membership.
      Much depends upon getting the right kind of men interested in the matter.
      Let the objects and work of this organization unfold and develop naturally
      and by degrees. It may take the form of a mechanics&rsquo; institute, a library,
      a gymnasium, a system of coffee-taverns, a lecture course With elevating
      popular exhibitions; and so I might go on, enumerating all the admirable
      things which similar bodies have inaugurated in other villages, both here
      and in Europe. I have made these matters, both at home and abroad, a
      subject of considerable observation; I am enthusiastic over the idea of
      setting some such machinery in motion here, and I am perfectly confident,
      once it is started, that the leading men of Thessaly will know how to make
      it produce results second to none in the whole worldwide field of
      philanthropic endeavor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When young Mr. Boyce had finished, there was a moment&rsquo;s hush. Then Reuben
      Tracy began to say that this expressed what he had in mind; but, before he
      had the words out, the match manufacturer exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever kind of organization we have, it will need a president, and I
      move that Mr. Horace Boyce be elected to that place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two or three people in the shadows behind clapped their hands. Horace
      protested that it was premature, irregular, that he was too young, etc.;
      but the match-maker was persistent, and on a vote there was no opposition.
      The Rev. Dr. Turner ceased smiling for a moment or two while this was
      going on, and twirled his thumbs nervously; but nobody paid any attention
      to him, and soon his face lightened again as his name was placed just
      before that of Father Chance on the general committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once started, the work of organization went forward briskly. It was
      decided at first to call the organization the &ldquo;Thessaly Reform Club,&rdquo; but
      two manufacturers suggested that this was only one remove from styling it
      a Cobden Club outright, and so the name was altered to &ldquo;Thessaly Citizens&rsquo;
      Club,&rdquo; and all professed themselves pleased. When the question of a
      treasurer came up, Reuben Tracy&rsquo;s name was mentioned, but some one asked
      if it would look just the thing to have the two principal officers in one
      firm, and so the match-maker consented to take the office instead. Even
      the committee on by-laws would have been made up without Reuben had not
      Horace interfered; then, upon John Fairchild&rsquo;s motion, he was made the
      chairman of that committee, while Fairchild himself was appointed
      secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meeting had broken up, and the men were putting on their
      overcoats and lighting fresh cigars, Dr. Lester took the opportunity of
      saying in an undertone to Reuben; &ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to have taken shape very nicely. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m! There&rsquo;s a good deal of Boyce in it so far, and damned little
      Tracy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben laughed. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be disturbed about that. He&rsquo;s the best man for
      the place. He&rsquo;s studied all these things in Europe&mdash;the cooperative
      institutes in the English industrial towns, and so on; and he&rsquo;ll put his
      whole soul into making this a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor sniffed audibly at this, but offered no further remark. Later
      on, however, when he was walking along in the crisp moonlight with John
      Fairchild, he unburdened his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was positively sickening,&rdquo; he growled, biting his cigar angrily, &ldquo;to
      see the way that young cub of a Boyce foisted himself upon the concern.
      I&rsquo;d bet any money he put up the whole thing with Jones. They nominated
      each other for president and treasurer&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you notice that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I noticed it,&rdquo; replied Fairchild, with something between a sigh and
      a groan. After a moment he added: &ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;m afraid Rube will find
      himself in a hole with that young man, before he gets through with him. It
      may sound funny to you, but I&rsquo;m deucedly nervous about it. I&rsquo;d rather see
      a hundred Boyces broiled alive than have harm come to so much as Tracy&rsquo;s
      little finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could have ailed him to go in blindfold like that into the
      partnership? He knew absolutely nothing of the fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told him a hundred times, he&rsquo;s got no more notion of reading
      characters than a mulley cow. Anybody can go up to him and wheedle his
      coat off his back, if he knows the first rudiments of the confidence game.
      It seems, in this special instance, that he took a fancy to Boyce because
      he saw him give two turkeys to old Ben Lawton, who&rsquo;d lost his money at a
      turkey-shoot and got no birds. He thought it was generous and noble and
      all that. So far as I can make out, that was his only reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Lester stopped short and looked at his companion. Then he burst out in
      a loud, shrill laugh, which renewed itself in intermittent gurgles of
      merriment so many times that Fairchild finally found them monotonous, and
      interposed a question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something besides fun in all this, Lester. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t professional to tell, my dear fellow, but there <i>is</i>
      something&mdash;you&rsquo;re right&mdash;and we are Reuben&rsquo;s friends against all
      the world; and this is what I laughed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in a low tone, as if even the white flaring moon and the jewelled
      stars in the cold sky had ears, he told his secret to his friend&mdash;a
      secret involving one small human being of whose very existence Mr. Horace
      Boyce had no knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl has come back here to Thessaly, you know,&rdquo; concluded the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairchild nodded assent. Then after a moment&rsquo;s thought he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we changed the name of the organization. That cuss <i>ought</i>
      to be the president of a Reform Club!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;=THE DAUGHTER OF THE MILLIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> YOUNG woman who
      is in her twenty-third year, who is possessed of bright wits, perfect
      health, great personal beauty, and a fortune of nearly a million of
      dollars in her own right, and who moreover is untroubled by a disquieting
      preference for any single individual in the whole army of males, ought
      not, by all the rules, to be unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate Minster defied the rules, and moped. Not infrequently she found
      herself in the mood to think, &ldquo;Now I realize how rich girls must feel when
      they commit themselves to entering a convent.&rdquo; Oftener still, perhaps, she
      caught her tongue framing impatient or even petulant answers to her
      mother, to her mother&rsquo;s friends, to everybody, in truth, save her sister
      Ethel. The conviction that she was bad-tempered had begun to enter her
      mind as it were without rapping, and with the air of a familiar. By dint
      of repeated searchings in the mirror, she had almost discovered a shadow
      between her brows which would presently develop into a wrinkle, and notify
      to the whole world her innate vixenish tendencies. And indeed, with all
      this brooding which grew upon her, it was something of a triumph for youth
      that the wrinkle had still failed to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that even queens yawn sometimes, when nobody is looking. But at
      least they have work to do, such as it is, and grow tired. Miss Kate had
      no work of any sort, and was utterly wearied. The vacuity of existence
      oppressed her with formless fatigue, like a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mischief was that all of his own tremendous energy which Stephen
      Minster had transmitted to the generation following him was concentrated
      in this eldest child of his. The son had been a lightheaded weakling. The
      other daughter, Ethel, was as fragile and tenderly delicate as a Christmas
      rose. But Kate had always been the strong one of the family, physically
      vigorous, restive under unintelligent discipline, rebellious to teachers
      she disliked, and proudly confident of her position, her ability, and the
      value of her plans and actions. She had loved her father passionately, and
      never ceased to mourn that, favorite of his though she was, business cares
      had robbed her of so much of his company for years before his death. As a
      girl she had dreamed her dreams&mdash;bold, sweepingly ambitious visions
      they were; but this father of whom she was so proud, this powerful father
      who had so manfully subdued things under his feet, was always the one who
      was to encompass their fulfilment. When he died, her aêrial castles at a
      stroke tumbled into chaos. All her plans and aspirations had turned upon
      him as their pivot. Without him all was disorganized, shapeless,
      incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly three years had gone by, and still matters about her and
      possibilities before her alike refused to take on definite outlines. She
      still did not do today the things she wanted to do, yet felt as powerless
      as ever to tell what her purposes for to-morrow clearly were. All the
      conditions for achievement were hers to command, and there was nothing to
      achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something alike grotesque and pathetic in the record of her
      attempts to find work. She had gathered at considerable expense all the
      books and data she could learn about relating to the life and surroundings
      of Lady Arabella Stuart, and had started to write what should be the
      authoritative work on the subject, only to discover that she did not know
      how to make a book, and would not want to make that kind of a book if she
      had known how. She had begun collections of orchids, of coins, of engraved
      portraits, of cameos, and, at varying times, of kindred other trifles, and
      then on some gray and rainy morning had found herself impelled to turn
      upon each of these in its order with disgust and wrath. For music she
      unluckily had no talent, and a very exhaustive and costly outfit of
      materials for a painter&rsquo;s studio amused her for less than one short month.
      She had a considerable feeling for color, but was too impatient to work
      laboriously at the effort to learn to draw; and so she hated her pictures
      while they were being painted, and laughed scornfully at them afterward.
      She wrote three or four short stories, full of the passions she had read
      about, and was chagrined to get them back from a whole group of polite but
      implacable editors. Embroidery she detested, and gardening makes one&rsquo;s
      back ache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minster was perfectly aware that other young ladies, similarly
      situated, got on very well indeed, without ever fluttering so much as a
      feather for a flight toward the ether beyond their own personal
      atmosphere; but she did not clearly comprehend what it was that they did
      like. She had seen something of their daily life&mdash;perhaps more of
      their amusements than of their occupations&mdash;and it was not wholly
      intelligible to her. They seemed able to extract entertainment from a host
      of things which were to her almost uninteresting. During her few visits to
      New York, Newport, and Saratoga, for the most part made during her
      father&rsquo;s lifetime, people had been extremely kind to her, and had done
      their best to make her feel that there existed for her, ready made, a very
      notable social position. She had been invited to more dinners than there
      were days at her disposal in which to eat them; she had been called with
      something like public acclamation the belle of sundry theatre parties; her
      appearance and her clothes had been canvassed with distinctly overfree
      flattery in one or two newspapers; she had danced a little, made a number
      of calls, suffered more than was usual from headaches, and yawned a great
      deal. The women whom she met all seemed to take it for granted that she
      was in the seventh heaven of enjoyment; and the young men with huge
      expanses of shirt front, who sprang up everywhere in indefinite profusion
      about her, like the clumps of white double-hollyhocks in her garden at
      home, were evidently altogether sincere in their desire to please her. But
      the women all received the next comer with precisely the smile they gave
      her; and the young men, aside from their eagerness to devise and provide
      diversions for her, and the obvious honesty of their liking for her, were
      deadly commonplace. She was always glad when it was time to return to
      Thessaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in this same village she was practically secluded from the society of
      her own generation. There were not a few excellent families in Thessaly
      who were on calling and even dining terms with the Minsters, but there had
      never been many children in these purely native households, and now most
      of the grown-up sons had gone to seek fortune in the great cities, and
      most of the girls had married either men who lived elsewhere or men who
      did not quite come within the Minsters&rsquo; social pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wearisome and vexatious thing, she said to herself very often,
      this barrier of the millions beyond which she must not even let her fancy
      float, and which encompassed her solitude like a prison wall. Often, too,
      she approached the point of meditating revolt, but only to realize with a
      fresh sigh that the thought was hopeless. What could she do? If the people
      of her own class, even with the advantages of amiable manners,
      cleanliness, sophisticated speech, and refined surroundings, failed to
      interest her, it was certain enough that the others would be even less
      tolerable. And she for whose own protection these impalpable defences
      against unpleasant people, adventurers, fortune-hunters, and the like, had
      all been reared, surely she ought to be the last in the world to wish them
      levelled. And then she would see, of course, that she did not wish this;
      yet, all the same, it was very, very dull!
    </p>
    <p>
      There must be whole troops of good folk somewhere whom she could know with
      pleasure and gain&mdash;nice women who would like her for herself, and
      clever men who would think it worth their while to be genuine with her,
      and would compliment her intelligence by revealing to it those high
      thoughts, phrased in glowing language, of which the master sex at its best
      is reputed to be capable&mdash;if only they would come in her way. But
      there were no signs betokening their advent, and she did not know where to
      look for them, and could not have sallied forth in the quest if she had
      known; and oh, but this was a weary world, and riches were mere useless
      rubbish, and life was a mistake!
    </p>
    <p>
      Patient, soft-eyed Ethel was the one to whom such of these repinings
      against existence as found their way into speech were customarily
      addressed. She was sympathetic enough, but hers was a temperament placid
      as it was tender, and Kate could do everything else save strike out sparks
      from it when her mood was for a conflagration. As for the mother, she knew
      in a general way that Kate had a complaining and unsatisfied disposition,
      and had always had it, and accepted the fact much as she did that of
      Ethel&rsquo;s poor health&mdash;as something which could not be helped, and
      therefore need not be worried about. Hence, she was but rarely made the
      confidante of her elder daughter&rsquo;s feelings, but Kate occasionally railed
      at destiny in the hearing of Miss Tabitha Wilcox, whom she liked sometimes
      much more than at others, but always enough to have a certain satisfaction
      in mildly bullying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know as well as I do, Tabitha,&rdquo; said Miss Kate one afternoon in
      January, rising from the couch where she had been lounging in sheer
      idleness, and walking over to the window with slow indolence of gait,
      &ldquo;that our whole life here is simply ridiculous. We girls have lived here
      in Thessaly ever since we were little children, and if we left the place
      for good to-morrow, positively there would not be a single personal tie to
      be broken. So far as making friends go, we might as well have lived in the
      moon, where I believe it is settled that there are no people at all. And
      pray what is there in life worth having but friends&mdash;I mean real
      friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had supposed,&rdquo; began the little lady with the iron-gray curls, who sat
      primly beside the window at one corner of the great drawing-room&mdash;&ldquo;I
      had supposed that <i>I</i> would be reckoned among&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t take me up in that way, Tabitha! Of course, I reckoned you&mdash;you
      know that well enough&mdash;that is, you count and you don&rsquo;t count, for
      you are like one of us. Besides, I was thinking of people of my own age.
      There are some few nice girls here, but they are never frank with me as
      they are among themselves; I suppose because they are always thinking that
      I am rich. And how many young men do I know? Say ten, and I always think I
      can see dollar-marks shining in their eyes whenever I look at them.
      Certainly they have nothing else inside their heads that would shine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you exaggerate their&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Tabitha! Don&rsquo;t be sure of any such thing. They couldn&rsquo;t be
      exaggerated; they wouldn&rsquo;t bear it. Candidly now, can you think of a
      single man in the place whom you would like to hear mentioned as
      entertaining the shadow of a hope that some time he might be&mdash;what
      shall I say?&mdash;allowed to cherish the possibility of becoming the&mdash;the
      son-in-law of my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think your mind ran on such&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; broke in the girl, &ldquo;not in the least, I assure you. I
      put it in that way merely to show you what I mean. You can&rsquo;t associate on
      terms of equality with people who would almost be put out of the house if
      they ventured to dream of asking you to marry them. Both sides are at a
      disadvantage. Don&rsquo;t you see what I mean? There is a wall between them.
      That is why I say we have no friends here; money brings us nothing that is
      of value; this isn&rsquo;t like a home at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, and everybody is talking of how much Thessaly has improved of late
      years. And quite nice people coming in, too! They say the Bidwells, who
      already talk of building a second factory for their button business&mdash;they
      say they moved in very good society indeed at Troy. I&rsquo;ve met Mrs. Bid-well
      twice at church sociables&mdash;the stout lady, you know, with the false
      front. They seem quite a knowable family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate did not reply, but drummed on the window-pane and watched the fierce
      quarrels of some English sparrows flitting about on the frozen snow
      outside. Miss Tabitha went on with more animation than sequence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ve heard of the club they&rsquo;re going to start, or have
      started; they call it the Thessaly Citizens&rsquo; Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? the Bidwells?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! The young men of the village&mdash;or I suppose it will
      soon be a city now. They tell all sorts of stories about what this club is
      going to do; reform the whole town, if you believe them. I always
      understood a club was for men to drink and play cards and sit up to all
      hours in, but it seems this is to be different. At any rate, several
      clergymen, Dr. Turner among them, have joined it, and Horace Boyce was
      elected president.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sparrows had disappeared, but Kate made no answer, and musingly kept
      her eyes fastened on the snow where the disagreeable birds had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a young man,&rdquo; said Miss Tabitha, after a pause. Still
      no comment came from the window, and so the elder maiden drifted forward:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Horace Boyce now. You don&rsquo;t hear anything else. Everybody is
      saying he will soon be our leading man. They tell me that he speaks
      beautifully&mdash;in public, I mean&mdash;and he is so good-looking and so
      bright; they all expect he&rsquo;ll make quite a mark when court sits next
      month. I suppose hell throw his partner altogether into the shade;
      everybody at least seems to think so. And Reuben Tracy had <i>such</i> a
      chance&mdash;once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall, dark girl at the window still did not turn, but she took up the
      conversation with an accent of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Had</i> a chance&mdash;what do you mean? I&rsquo;ve never heard a word
      against him, except that idle story you told here once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idle or not, Kate, you can&rsquo;t deny that the girl is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate laughed, in scornful amusement. &ldquo;No; and so winter is here, and you
      are here, and the snowbirds are here, and all the rest of it. But what
      does that go to show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that reminds me,&rdquo; exclaimed Tabitha, leaning forward in her chair
      with added eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;now, what <i>do</i> you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The processes by which you are reminded of things, Tabitha, are not fit
      subjects for light and frivolous brains like mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laugh; but you really never <i>could</i> guess it in all your born
      days. That Lawton girl&mdash;she&rsquo;s actually a tenant of mine; or, that is,
      she rented from another party, but she&rsquo;s in <i>my house!</i> You can just
      fancy what a state I was in when I heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean? What house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know those places of mine on Bridge Street&mdash;rickety old houses
      they&rsquo;re getting to be now, though I must say they&rsquo;ve stood much better
      than some built years and years after my father put them up, for he was
      the most thorough man about such things you ever saw, and as old Major
      Schoonmaker once said of him, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what about that&mdash;that girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tabitha returned to her subject without impatience. All her life she had
      been accustomed to being pulled up and warned from rambling, and if her
      hearers neglected to do this the responsibility for the omission was their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know the one-story-and-attic place, painted brown, and
      flat-roofed, just beyond where the Truemans live. It seems as if I had had
      more than forty tenants for that place. Everybody that can&rsquo;t keep a store
      anywhere, and make a living, seems to hit upon that identical building to
      fail in. Old Ikey Peters was the last; he started a sort of fish store,
      along with peanuts and toys and root beer, and he came to me a month or
      two back and said it was no go; he couldn&rsquo;t pay the rent any more, and
      he&rsquo;d got a job as night watchman: so if he found another tenant, might he
      turn it over to him until the first of May, when his year would be up? and
      I said, &lsquo;Yes, if it isn&rsquo;t for a saloon.&rsquo; And next I heard he had rented
      the place to a woman who had come from Tecumseh to start a milliner&rsquo;s
      shop. I went past there a few days afterward, and I saw Ben Lawton fooling
      around inside with a jack-plane, fixing up a table; but even then I hadn&rsquo;t
      a suspicion in the world. It must have been a week later that I went by
      again, and there I saw the sign over the door, &lsquo;J. Lawton&mdash;Millinery;&rsquo;
      and would you believe it, even <i>then</i> I didn&rsquo;t dream of what was up!
      So in walks I, to say &lsquo;how do you do,&rsquo; and lo and behold! there was Ben
      Lawton&rsquo;s eldest girl running the place, and quite as much at home as I
      was. You could have knocked me over with a feather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite appropriately, in a milliner&rsquo;s shop, too,&rdquo; said Kate, who had taken
      a chair opposite to Tabitha&rsquo;s and seemed really interested in her
      narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there she was, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened next? Did you faint or run away, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she was quite civil, I must say. She recognized me&mdash;she used to
      see me at my sister&rsquo;s when she worked there&mdash;and asked me to sit
      down, and explained that she hadn&rsquo;t got entirely settled yet. Yes, I must
      admit that she was polite enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How tiresome of her! Now, if she had thrown boiling water on you, or even
      made faces at you, it would have been something like. But to ask you to
      sit down! And <i>did</i> you sit down, Tabitha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I could have done otherwise. And she really has a great
      deal of taste in her work. She saw in a minute what&rsquo;s been the trouble
      with my bonnets&mdash;you know I always told you there was something&mdash;they
      were not high enough in front. Don&rsquo;t you think yourself, now, that this is
      an improvement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wilcox lifted her chin, and turned her head slowly around for
      inspection; but, instead of the praise which was expected, there came a
      merry outburst of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really bought a bonnet of her!&rdquo; Kate laughed again at the
      thought, and then, with a sudden impulse, rose from her chair, glided
      swiftly to where Tabitha sat, and kissed her. &ldquo;You softhearted,
      ridiculous, sweet old thing!&rdquo; she said, beaming at her, and smoothing the
      old maid&rsquo;s cheek in affectionate patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabitha smiled with pleasure at this rare caress, and preened her head and
      thin shoulders with a bird-like motion. But then the serious side of her
      experience loomed once more before her, and the smile vanished as swiftly
      as it had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not living with her father, you know. She and one of her
      half-sisters have had the back rooms rigged up to live in, and there they
      are by themselves. I guess she saw by my face that I didn&rsquo;t think much of
      <i>that</i> part of the business. Still, thank goodness, it&rsquo;s only till
      the first of May!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you turn them out then, Tabitha?&rdquo; Kate spoke seriously now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place has always been respectable, Kate, even if it is tumble-down.
      To be sure, I did hear certain stories about the family of the man who
      sold non-explosive oil there two years ago, and his wife frizzed her hair
      in a way that went against my grain, I must admit; but it would never do
      to have a scandal about one of my houses, not even <i>that</i> one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about these people, of course,&rdquo; said Kate, slowly and
      thoughtfully; &ldquo;but it seems to me, to speak candidly, Tabitha, that you
      are the only one who is making what you call a scandal. No&mdash;wait; let
      me finish. In some curious way the thought of this girl has kept itself in
      my head&mdash;perhaps it was because she came back here on the same train
      with me, or something else equally trivial. Perhaps she is as bad a
      character as you seem to think, but it may also be that she only wants a
      little help to be a good girl and to make an honest living for herself. To
      me, her starting a shop like that here in her native village seems to show
      that she wants to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Kate, everybody knows her character. There&rsquo;s no secret in the world
      about <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I am right about her present wish. Suppose that she does
      truly want to rehabilitate herself. Would you like to have it on your
      conscience that you put so much as a straw in her way, let alone turned
      her out of the little home she has made for herself? I know you better
      than that, Tabitha: you couldn&rsquo;t bring yourself to do it. But there is
      this other thing. You may do her a great deal of injury by talking about
      her, as, for example, you have been talking to me here to-day. I am going
      to ask you a favor, a real personal favor. I want you to promise me not to
      mention that girl&rsquo;s name again to a living soul until&mdash;when shall I
      say?&mdash;until the first of May; and if anybody else mentions it, to say
      nothing at all. Now, will you promise that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you wish it, but I assure you there wasn&rsquo;t the slightest
      doubt in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t care about. Why should we women be so brutal to each other?
      You and I had good homes, good fathers, and never knew what it was to want
      for anything, or to fight single-handed against the world. How can we tell
      what might have crushed and overwhelmed us if we had been really down in
      the thick of the battle, instead of watching it from a private box up
      here? No: give the girl a chance, and remember your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it, she has been to church twice now, two Sundays
      running. And Mrs. Turner spoke to her in the vestibule, seeing that she
      was a stranger and neatly dressed, and didn&rsquo;t dream who she was; and she
      told me she was never so mortified in her life as when she found out
      afterward. A clergyman&rsquo;s wife has to be so particular, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kate answered, absently. Her heart was full of bitter and sardonic
      things to say about Mrs. Turner and her conceptions of the duties of a
      pastor&rsquo;s helpmeet, but she withheld them because they might grieve
      Tabitha, and then was amazed at herself for being so considerate, and then
      fell to wondering whether she, too, was bitten by this Pharisaical spirit,
      and so started as out of a dream when Tabitha rose and said she must go
      and see Mrs. Minster before she took her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember your promise,&rdquo; Kate said, with a little smile and another
      caress. She had not been so affectionate before in a long, long time, and
      the old maid mused flightily on this unwonted softness as she found her
      way up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl returned to the window and looked out once more upon the smooth
      white crust which, broken only by half-buried dwarf firs, stretched across
      the wide lawn. When at last she wearied of the prospect and her thoughts,
      and turned to join the family on the floor above, she confided these words
      aloud to the solitude of the big room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost wish I could start a milliner&rsquo;s shop myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The depreciatory reflection that she had never discovered in all these
      years what was wrong with Tabitha&rsquo;s bonnets rose with comical suddenness
      in her mind, and she laughed as she opened the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;HORACE EMBARKS UPON THE ADVENTURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>oung Mr. Boyce was
      spared the trouble of going to Florida, and relieved from the
      embarrassment of inventing lies to his partner about the trip, which was
      even more welcome. Only a few days after the interview with Mrs. Minster,
      news came of the unexpected death of Lawyer Clarke, caused by one of those
      sudden changes of temperature at sunset which have filled so many
      churchyards in that sunny clime. His executors were both resident in
      Thessaly, and at a word from Mrs. Minster they turned over to Horace the
      box containing the documents relating to her affairs. Only one of these
      executors, old &rsquo;Squire Gedney, expressed any comment upon Mrs.
      Minster&rsquo;s selection, at least in Horace&rsquo;s hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Gedney was a slovenly and mumbling old man, the leading
      characteristics of whose appearance were an unshaven jaw, a general
      shininess and disorder of apparel, and a great deal of tobacco-juice. It
      was still remembered that in his youth he had promised to be an important
      figure at the bar and in politics. His failure had been exceptionally
      obvious and complete, but for some occult reason Thessaly had a soft
      corner in its heart for him, even when his estate bordered upon the
      disreputable, and for many years had been in the habit of electing him to
      be one of its justices of the peace. The functions of this office he
      avowedly employed in the manner best calculated to insure the livelihood
      which his fellow-citizens expected him to get out of it. His principal
      judicial maxim was never to find a verdict against the party to a suit who
      was least liable to pay him his costs. If justice could be made to fit
      with this rule, so much the better for justice. But, in any event, the &rsquo;squire
      must look out primarily for his costs. He made no concealment of this
      theory and practice; and while some citizens who took matters seriously
      were indignant about it, the great majority merely laughed and said the
      old man had got to live somehow, and voted good-naturedly for him next
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Calvin Gedney owed much to the amiability and friendly feeling of his
      fellow-townsmen, he repaid the debt but poorly in kind. No bitterer or
      more caustic tongue than his wagged in all Dearborn County. When he was in
      a companiable mood, and stood around in the cigar store and talked for the
      delectation of the boys of an evening, the range and scope of his personal
      sneers and sarcasms would expand under the influence of applauding
      laughter, until no name, be it never so honored, was sacred from his
      attack, save always one&mdash;that of Minster. There was a popular
      understanding that Stephen Minster had once befriended Gedney, and that
      that accounted for the exception; but this was rendered difficult of
      credence by the fact that so many other men had befriended Gedney, and yet
      now served as targets for his most rancorous jeers. Whatever the reason
      may have been, however, the &rsquo;squire&rsquo;s affection for the memory of
      Stephen Minster, and his almost defiant reverence for the family he had
      left behind, were known to all men, and regarded as creditable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this was in some way accountable for the fact that the &rsquo;squire
      remained year after year in old Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s will as an executor, long
      after he had ceased to be regarded as a responsible person by the village
      at large, for Mr. Clarke also was devoted to the Minsters. At all events,
      he was so named in the will, in conjunction with a non-legal brother of
      the deceased, and it was in this capacity that he addressed some remarks
      to Mr. Horace Boyce when he handed over to him the Minster papers. The
      scene was a small and extremely dirty chamber off the justice&rsquo;s
      court-room, furnished mainly by a squalid sofa-bed, a number of empty
      bottles on the bare floor, and a thick overhanging canopy of cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; said the &rsquo;squire, expectorating indefinitely among
      the bottles, &ldquo;and God help &rsquo;em! What it all means beats me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you needn&rsquo;t worry, Cal,&rdquo; answered Horace lightly, in the easily
      familiar tone which Thessaly always adopted toward its unrespected
      magistrate. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come out and have a drink; then you&rsquo;ll see
      things brighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn your impudence, you young cub!&rdquo; shouted the &rsquo;squire, flaming
      up into sudden and inexplicable wrath. &ldquo;Who are you calling &lsquo;Cal&rsquo;? By the
      Eternal, when I was your age, I&rsquo;d have as soon bitten off my tongue as
      dared call a man of my years by his Christian name! I can remember your
      great-grandfather, the judge, sir. I was admitted before he died; and I
      tell you, sir, that if it had been possible for me to venture upon such a
      piece of cheek with him, he&rsquo;d have taken me over his knee, by Gawd! and
      walloped me before the whole assembled bar of Dearborn County!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man had worked himself up into a feverish reminiscence of his
      early stump-speaking days, and he trembled and spluttered over his
      concluding words with unwonted excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace felt disposed to laugh. People always did laugh at &ldquo;Cal&rdquo; Gedney,
      and laugh most when he grew strenuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get the drink first,&rdquo; he said, putting the box under his
      arm, &ldquo;and <i>then</i> free your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you food for worms, first!&rdquo; shouted the &rsquo;squire, still
      furiously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your papers, and I&rsquo;ve got my opinion, and that&rsquo;s
      all there is &rsquo;twixt you and me. There&rsquo;s the door that the
      carpenters made, and I guess they were thinking of you when they made it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, you&rsquo;re amusing this morning, &rsquo;squire,&rdquo; said Horace,
      looking with aroused interest at the vehement justice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
      with you? Don&rsquo;t your clothes fit you? Come around to the house and I&rsquo;ll
      rig you up in some new ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &rsquo;squire began with a torrent of explosive profanity, framed in
      gestures which almost threatened personal violence. All at once he stopped
      short, looked vacantly at the floor, and then sat down on his bed, burying
      his face in his hands. From the convulsive clinching of his fingers among
      the grizzled, unkempt locks of hair, and the heaving of his chest, Horace
      feared he was going to have a fit, and, advancing, put a hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &rsquo;squire shook it off roughly, and raised his haggard,
      deeply-furrowed face. It was a strong-featured countenance still, and had
      once been handsome as well, but what it chiefly said to Horace now was
      that the old man couldn&rsquo;t stand many more such nights of it as this last
      had evidently been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, &rsquo;squire, I didn&rsquo;t want to annoy you. I&rsquo;m sorry if I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You insulted me,&rdquo; said the old man, with a dignity which quavered into
      pathos as he added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got so low now, by Gawd, that even you can
      insult me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace smiled at the impracticability of all this. &ldquo;What the deuce is it
      all about, anyway?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What have you got against me? I&rsquo;ve always
      been civil to you, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no good,&rdquo; was the justice&rsquo;s concise explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed outright. &ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said,
      pleasantly, as one humors a child. &ldquo;<i>Now</i> will you come out and have
      a drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been forty-four years at the bar for nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not! Whole generations of barkeepers can testify to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell,&rdquo; went on the old man, ignoring the jest, and rising from the
      bed as he spoke; &ldquo;I can tell when a man&rsquo;s got an honest face. I can tell
      when he means to play fair. And I wouldn&rsquo;t trust you one inch farther, Mr.
      Horace Boyce, than I could throw a bull by the tail. I tell you that, sir,
      straight to your teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace, still with the box snugly under his arm, had sauntered out into
      the dark and silent courtroom. He turned now, half smiling, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third and last call&mdash;<i>do</i> you want a drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s answer was to slam the door in his face with a noise which
      rang in reverberating echoes through the desolate hall of justice. Horace,
      still smiling, went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning had lapsed into afternoon, and succeeding hours had brought
      the first ashen tints of dusk into the winter sky, before the young man
      completed his examination of the Minster papers. He had taken them to his
      own room in his father&rsquo;s house, sending word to the office that he had a
      cold and would not come down that day; and it was behind a locked door
      that he had studied the documents which stood for millions. On a sheet of
      paper he made certain memoranda from time to time, and now that the search
      was ended, he lighted a fresh cigar, and neatly reduced these to a little
      tabular statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0196.jpg" alt="0196 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0196.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When Horace had finished this he felt justified in helping himself to some
      brandy and soda. It was the most interesting and important computation
      upon which he had ever engaged, and its noble proportions grew upon him
      momentarily as he pondered them and sipped his drink. More than two and a
      quarter millions lay before his eyes, within reach of his hand. Was it not
      almost as if they were his? And of course this did not represent
      everything. There was sundry village property that he knew about; there
      would be bank accounts, minor investments and so on, quite probably
      raising the total to nearly or quite two millions and a half. Oh, to think
      of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had only put things down at par values. The telegraph stock was
      quoted at a trifle less, just now, but if there had been any Minster
      Iron-works stock for sale, it would command a heavy premium. The
      scattering investments, too, which yielded an average of five per cent.,
      must be worth a good deal more than their face. What he didn&rsquo;t like about
      the thing was that big block of Thessaly Manufacturing Company stock. That
      seemed to be earning nothing at all; he could find no record of dividends,
      or, in truth, any information whatever about it. Where had he heard about
      that company before? The name was curiously familiar to his mind; he had
      been told something about it&mdash;by whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once it flashed upon him. That was the company of which the
      mysterious Judge Wendover was president. Tenney had talked about it;
      Tenney had told him that he would hear a good deal about it before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these reflections rose in the young man&rsquo;s mind, the figures which he
      had written down on the paper seemed to diminish in size and significance.
      It was a queer notion, but he couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that the millions had
      somehow moved themselves farther back, out of his reach. The thought of
      these two men&mdash;of the gray-eyed, thin-lipped, abnormally smart
      Tenney, and of that shadowy New York financier who shared his secrets&mdash;made
      him nervous. They had a purpose, and he was more or less linked to it and
      to them, and Heaven only knew where he might be dragged in the dark. He
      finished his glass and resolved that he would no longer remain in the
      dark. To-morrow he would see Tenney and Mrs. Minster and Reuben, and have
      a clear understanding all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came sharp and loud upon his door a peremptory knocking, and Horace
      with a swift movement slipped the paper on which he had made the figures
      into the box, and noiselessly closed the cover. Then he opened the door,
      and discovered before him a man whom for the instant, in the dim light of
      the hall, he did not recognize. The man advanced a step, and then Horace
      saw that it was&mdash;strangely changed and unlike himself&mdash;his
      father!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you come in,&rdquo; said the young man, vaguely confused by the
      altered appearance of the General, and trying in some agitation of mind to
      define the change and to guess what it portended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me you were here,&rdquo; said the father, moving lumpishly forward
      into the room, and sinking into a chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it. I want to talk
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had suddenly grown muffled, as if with age or utter weariness.
      His hands lay palm upward and inert on his fat knees, and he buried his
      chin in his collar helplessly. The gaze which he fastened opaquely upon
      the waste-paper basket, and the posture of his relaxed body, suggested to
      Horace a simple explanation. Evidently this was the way his delightful
      progenitor looked when he was drunk. It was not a nice sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to go to bed now, and talk afterward?&rdquo; said the
      young man, with asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General looked up at his son. He clearly understood the purport of the
      question, and gathered his brows at first in a half-scowl. Then the humor
      of the position appealed to him, and he smiled instead&mdash;a grim and
      terrifying smile which seemed to darken rather than illumine his purplish
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think I was drunk, that you should say that?&rdquo; he asked, with the
      ominous smile still on his lips. He added, more slowly, and with something
      of his old dignity: &ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m merely ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has come, has it?&rdquo; The young man heard himself saying these words, but
      they sounded as if they had issued from other lips than his. He had
      schooled himself for a fortnight to realize that his father was actually
      insolvent, yet the shock seemed to find him all unprepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you expected it? You knew about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tenney told me last month that it must come, sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General offered an invocation as to Mr. Tenney&rsquo;s present existence and
      future state which, solemnly impressive though it was, may not be set down
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I say, too, if you like,&rdquo; answered Horace, beginning to pace the room.
      &ldquo;But that will hardly help us just now. Tell me just what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, then: you make me nervous, tramping about like that. The
      villain simply asked me to step into the office for a minute, and then
      took out his note-book, cool as a cucumber. &lsquo;I thought I&rsquo;d call your
      attention to how things stand between us.&rsquo; he said, as if I&rsquo;d been a
      country customer who was behindhand with his paper. Then the scoundrel
      calmly went on to say that my interest in the partnership was worth less
      than nothing; that I already owed him more than the interest would come
      to, if the business were sold out, and that he would like to know what I
      proposed to do about it. By Heaven! that&rsquo;s what he said to me, and I sat
      there and listened to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him what I thought of him. He hasn&rsquo;t heard so much straight, solid
      truth about himself before since he was weaned, I&rsquo;ll bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what good was that? He isn&rsquo;t the sort who minds that kind of thing.
      What did you tell him you would do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break his infernal skull for him if he ever spoke to me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace almost smiled, as he felt how much older he was than this
      red-faced, white-haired boy, who could fight and drink and tell funny
      stories, world without end, but was powerless to understand business even
      to the extent of protecting his interest in a hardware store. But the
      tendency to smile was painfully short-lived; the subject was too serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell <i>me</i>, then, what you are going to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; broke forth the General, raising his head again. &ldquo;What <i>can</i>
      I do! Crawl into a hole and die somewhere, I should think. I don&rsquo;t see
      anything else. But before I do, mark me, I&rsquo;ll have a few minutes alone
      with that scoundrel, in his office, in the street, wherever I can find
      him; and if I don&rsquo;t fix him up so that his own mother won&rsquo;t know him, then
      my name isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Vane&rsquo; Boyce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut-tut,&rdquo; said the prudent lawyer of the family. &ldquo;Men don&rsquo;t die because
      they fail in the hardware business, and this isn&rsquo;t Kentucky. We don&rsquo;t
      thrash our enemies up here in the North. Do you want me to see Tenney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so&mdash;if you can stomach a talk with the whelp. He said
      something, too, about talking it over with you, but I was too raving mad
      to listen. Have you had any dealings with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing definite. We&rsquo;ve discussed one or two little things&mdash;in the
      air&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General rose and helped himself to some neat brandy from his son&rsquo;s <i>liqueur</i>-stand.
      &ldquo;Well, if you do&mdash;you hear me&mdash;he&rsquo;ll singe you clean as a
      whistle. By God, he won&rsquo;t leave so much as a pin-feather on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace smiled incredulously. &ldquo;I rather think I can take care of Mr.
      Schuyler Tenney,&rdquo; said he, with a confident front. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down and see
      him now, if you like, and don&rsquo;t you worry yourself about it. I daresay I
      can straighten it out all right. The best thing you can do is to say
      nothing at all about your affairs to anybody. It might complicate matters
      if he heard that you had been publicly proclaiming your intention of
      beating him into a jelly. I don&rsquo;t know, but I can fancy that he might not
      altogether like that. And, above all things, don&rsquo;t get down on your luck.
      I guess we can keep our heads above water, Tenney or no Tenney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man felt that it was distinctly decent of him to thus assume
      responsibility for the family, and did not look to see the General take it
      so much as a matter of course. But that distinguished soldier had quite
      regained his spirits, and smacked his lips over a second glass of brandy
      with smiling satisfaction, as if Tenney had already been turned out of the
      hardware store, neck and crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! You go ahead, and let him have it from the shoulder. Give him
      one for me, while you&rsquo;re about it,&rdquo; he said, with his old robust voice and
      hearty manner all come back again. The elasticity of this stout man&rsquo;s
      temperament was a source of perpetual wonderment to his slender son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Horace, too, had much the same singular capacity for shaking off
      trouble, and he saw matters in quite a hopeful light as he strode along
      down toward Main Street. Clearly Tenney had only meant to frighten the
      General.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his father&rsquo;s partner in the little office boxed off the store,
      and had a long talk with him&mdash;a talk prolonged, in fact, until after
      business hours. When he reflected upon this conversation during his
      homeward journey, he could recall most distinctly that he had told Tenney
      everything about the Minsters which the search of the papers revealed.
      Somehow, the rest of the talk had not seemed to be very important. Tenney
      had laughed lightly when the question of the General came up, and said:
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t bother about that. I only wanted him to know how things
      stood. He can go on as long as he likes; that is, of course, if you and I
      continue to work together.&rdquo; And Horace had said that he was much obliged,
      and would be glad to work with Mr. Tenney&mdash;and really that had been
      the sum of the whole conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or yes, there had been one other thing. Tenney had said that it would be
      best now to tell Reuben Tracy that Mrs. Minster had turned over her
      affairs to him&mdash;temporarily, at least&mdash;but not to discuss them
      with him at all, and not to act as if he thought they were of special
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace felt that this could easily be done. Reuben was the least
      suspicious man in the world, and the matter might be so stated to him that
      he would never give it a second thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General received over the supper-table the tidings that no evil was
      intended to him, much as his son had expected him to; that is, with
      perfectly restored equanimity. He even admitted that Tenney was within his
      rights to speak as he did, and that there should be no friction provoked
      by any word or act of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the man, you know,&rdquo; he said, between mouthfuls, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
      just as well that I should stick by him. He&rsquo;s skinned me dry, and my only
      chance is now to keep friendly with him, in the hope that when he begins
      skinning other people he&rsquo;ll let me make myself good out of the proceeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This worldly wisdom, emanating from such an unlikely source, surprised the
      young man, and he looked up with interest to his father&rsquo;s face,
      red-shining under the lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I say,&rdquo; continued the General, who ate with unfailing gusto
      as he talked. &ldquo;Tenney as much as said that to me himself, awhile ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace nodded with comprehension. He had thought the aphorism too concise
      and strong for his father&rsquo;s invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I could guess with my eyes shut how he&rsquo;s going to do it,&rdquo; the elder
      Boyce went on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a lot of the stock of the Thessaly Manufacturing
      Company, the one that&rsquo;s built the rolling mills in connection with the
      Minster iron-works, and the rest of the stock is held in New York; and
      some fine day the New Yorkers will wake up and find themselves cleaned
      out. Oh, I know Mr. Tenney&rsquo;s little ways!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General wagged his round head upon its thick neck with complacency at
      his superior insight, but Horace finished his supper in silence. He did
      not see very far into the millstone yet, but already he guessed that the
      stockholders who were to be despoiled lived in Thessaly and not New York.
      A strange, amorphous vision of the looting of the millions arose like a
      mirage between him and the shaded lamplight, and he looked into its
      convolving vortex half in terror, half in trembling fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he felt himself impelled to say&mdash;why he could not tell&mdash;&ldquo;I
      might as well speak to you about it. It is my ambition to marry Miss Kate
      Minster. I think I shall succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General almost upset his chair in his eagerness to rise, lean over the
      table, and shake hands with his son.

      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;THE LAWTON GIRL&rsquo;S WORK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ORTUNATELY Jessica
      Lawton&rsquo;s humble little business enterprise began to bring in returns
      before her slender store of money was quite exhausted. Even more
      fortunate, at least in her estimation, was the fact that the lion&rsquo;s share
      of this welcome patronage came from the poor working-girls of the village.
      When the venture was a month old, there was nearly enough work to occupy
      all her time, and, taking into account the season, this warranted her in
      believing that she had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result had not come without many anxious days, made bitter alike by
      despairing tremors for the future and burning indignation at the insults
      and injuries of the present. Now that these had in a measure abated, she
      felt, in looking back upon them, that the fear of failure was always the
      least of her troubles. At the worst, the stock which, through Mrs.
      Fairchild&rsquo;s practical kindness, she had been able to bring from Tecumseh,
      could be sold for something like its cost. Her father&rsquo;s help had sufficed
      for nearly all the changes needed in the small tenement, and she had money
      enough to pay the rent until May.
    </p>
    <p>
      The taking over of Lucinda was a more serious matter, for the girl had
      been a wage-earner, and would be entitled to complain if it turned out
      that she had been decoyed away from the factory on an empty promise. But
      Lucinda, so far from complaining, seemed exceptionally contented. It was
      true that she gave no promise of ever acquiring skill as a milliner, and
      she was not infrequently restless under the discipline which Jessica, with
      perhaps exaggerated caution, strove to impose, but she worked with great
      diligence in their tiny kitchen, and served customers in the store with
      enthusiasm if not <i>finesse</i>. The task of drilling her into that habit
      of mind which considers finger-nails and is mindful of soap was distinctly
      onerous, and even now had reached only a stage in which progress might be
      reported; but much could be forgiven a girl who was so cheerful and who
      really tried so hard to do her share.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the disagreeable experiences, which had once or twice been
      literally terrifying, the girl still grew sick at heart with rage and
      shame and fear that they might jeopardize her plans, when she thought of
      them. In their ruder aspects they were divisible into two classes. A
      number of young men, sometimes in groups of twos or threes, but more often
      furtively and alone, had offensively sought to make themselves at home in
      the store, and had even pounded on the door in the evening after it was
      shut and bolted; a somewhat larger number of rough factory-girls, or
      idlers of the factory-girl class, had come from time to time with the
      obvious intention of insulting her. These latter always appeared in gangs,
      and supported one another in cruel giggling and in coarse inquiries and
      remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few painfully futile attempts to meet and rebuff these hostile
      waves, Jessica gave up the effort, and arranged matters so that she could
      work in the living-room beyond, within call if she were needed, but out of
      the visual range of her persecutors. Lucinda encountered them instead, and
      gave homely but vigorous Rolands for their Olivers. It was in the
      interchange of these remarks that the chief danger, to the struggling
      little business lay, for if genuine customers heard them, why, there was
      an end to everything. It is not easy to portray the girl&rsquo;s relief as week
      after week went by, and time brought not only no open scandal, but a
      marked diminution of annoyance. When Jessica was no longer visible,
      interest in the sport lagged. To come merely for the sake of baiting
      Lucinda was not worth the while. And when these unfriendly visits
      slackened, and then fell off almost altogether, Jessica hugged to her
      breast the notion that it was because these rough young people had
      softened toward and begun to understand and sympathize with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the easier to credit this kindly hypothesis in that she had already
      won the suffrages of a considerable circle of working-girls. To explain
      how this came about would be to analyze many curious and apparently
      contradictory phases of untutored human nature, and to recount many
      harmless little stratagems and well-meant devices, and many other frankly
      generous words and actions which came from hearts not the less warm
      because they beat amid the busy whir of the looms, or throbbed to the time
      of the seamstress&rsquo;s needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica&rsquo;s own heart was uplifted with exultation, sometimes, when she
      thought upon the friendliness of these girls. So far as she knew and
      believed, every one of them was informed as to her past, and there was no
      reason beyond their own inclination why they should take stock in her
      intentions for the future. To a slender few, originally suggested by
      Lucinda, and then confirmed by her own careful scrutiny, she had confided
      the crude outlines of her scheme&mdash;that is, to build up a following
      among the toilers of her own sex, to ask from this following no more than
      a decent living for work done, and to make this work include not merely
      the details of millinery and hints about dress, but a general mental and
      material helpfulness, to take practical form step by step as the means
      came to hand and the girls themselves were ready for the development.
      Whenever she had tried to put this into words, its melancholy vagueness
      had been freshly apparent to her, but the girls had believed in her! That
      was the great thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they had brought others, and spread the favorable report about, until
      even now, in the dead season, lying half way between Christmas and the
      beginning of Lent, she was kept quite busy. To be sure, her patrons were
      not governed much by these holiday dates at any time, and she was
      undoubtedly doing their work better and more cheaply than it could ever
      have been done for them before, but their good spirit in bringing it was
      none the less evident for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And out of the contact with this good spirit, Jessica began to be dimly
      conscious of getting great stores of strength for herself. If it could be
      all like this, she felt that her life would be ideally happy. She had not
      the skill of mind to separate her feelings, and contrast and weigh them
      one against the other, but she knew clearly enough that she was doing what
      afforded her keen enjoyment, and it began to be apparent that merely by
      doing it she would come to see more clearly, day by day, how to expand and
      ennoble her work. The mission which Annie Fairchild had urged upon her and
      labored to fit her for, and which she had embraced and embarked upon with
      only the vaguest ideas as to means or details or specific aims, was
      unfolding itself inspiringly before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period she wrote daily to the good woman who had sent her upon
      this work&mdash;short letters setting forth tersely the events and outcome
      of the day&mdash;and the answers which came twice a week helped greatly to
      strengthen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And do not doubt that often she stood in grave need of strength! The mere
      matter of regular employment itself was still more or less of a novelty to
      her; regular hours still found her physically rebellious. The restraints
      of a shop, of studied demeanor, of frugal meals, of no intimate society
      save that of one dull girl,&mdash;these still wore gratingly upon her
      nerves, and produced periodical spasms of depression and gloom, in which
      she was much tortured by doubts about herself and the utility of what she
      was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, too, these doubts took the positive form of temptation&mdash;of
      a wild kind of longing to get back again into the atmosphere where bright
      lights shone on beautiful dresses, and the hours went swiftly, gayly by
      with jest, and song, and the sparkle of the amber air-beads rising in the
      tall wine-glasses. There came always afterward the memory of those other
      hours which dragged most gruesomely, when the daylight made all tawdry and
      hateful once more, and heartaches ruled where smiles had been. Yet still
      these unbidden yearnings would come, and then the girl would set her teeth
      tight together, and thrust her needle through the mutinous tears till they
      were exorcised.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been in her unshaped original plan to do a good deal for her
      father, but this proved to be more easily contemplated than done. Once the
      little rooms had been made habitable for her and Lucinda, there remained
      next to nothing for him to do. He came around every morning, when some
      extraordinary event, such as a job of work or a fire, did not interfere,
      and offered his services, but he knew as well as they did that this was a
      mere amiable formality. He developed a great fondness for sitting by the
      stove in Jessica&rsquo;s small working room, and either watching her industrious
      fingers or sleeping calmly in his chair. Perhaps the filial instinct was
      not strong in Lucinda&rsquo;s composition; perhaps it had been satiated by
      over-close contact during those five years of Jessica&rsquo;s absence. At any
      rate, the younger girl did not enjoy Ben&rsquo;s presence as much as her sister
      seemed to, and almost daily detracted from his comfort by suggestions that
      the apartments were very small, and that a man hanging around all day took
      up a deplorable amount of room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been Jessica&rsquo;s notion, too, that she and her sister would walk out
      in the evenings under the escort of their father, and thus secure
      themselves from misapprehension. But Lucinda rebelled flatly against this,
      at least until Ben had some new clothes, and the money for these was not
      forthcoming. Jessica did find it possible to spare a dollar or so to her
      father weekly, and there had been a nebulous understanding that this was
      to be applied to raiment; but the only change in his appearance effected
      by this so far had been a sporadic accession of startlingly white paper
      collars.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other minor disappointments&mdash;portions of her plan, so to
      speak, which had failed to materialize&mdash;but the net result of a
      month&rsquo;s trial was distinctly hopeful. Although most of such work as had
      come to her was from the factory-girls, not a few ladies had visited the
      little store, and made purchases or given orders. Among these she liked
      best of all the one who owned the house; a very friendly old person, with
      corkscrew curls and an endless tongue&mdash;Miss Tabitha Wilcox. She had
      already made two bonnets for her, and the elderly lady had been so
      pleasant and talkative that she had half resolved, when next she came in,
      to unfold to her the scheme which now lay nearest to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was nothing less than securing permission to use a long-deserted and
      roomy building which stood in the yard, at the back of the one she
      occupied, as a sort of evening club for the working-girls of the town.
      Jessica had never been in this building, but so far as she could see
      through the stained and dismantled windows, where the drifts did not
      render approach impossible, it had formerly been a dwelling-house, and
      later had been used in part as a carpenter&rsquo;s shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get this, and to fit it up simply but comfortably as a place where the
      tired factory and sewing girls could come in the evening, to read or talk
      or play games if they liked, to merely sit still and rest if they chose,
      but in either case to be warm and contented and sheltered from the streets
      and the deadly boredom of squalid lodgings, became little by little her
      abiding ambition. She had spoken tentatively to some of the girls about
      it, and they were all profoundly enthusiastic over the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained to enlist the more fortunate women whose assistance could
      alone make the plan feasible. Jessica had essayed to get at the parson&rsquo;s
      wife, Mrs. Turner; but that lady, after having been extremely cordial, had
      unaccountably all at once turned icy cold, and cut the girl dead in the
      street. I said &ldquo;unaccountably,&rdquo; but Jessica was not at all at a loss to
      comprehend the change, and the bitterness of the revelation had thrown her
      into an unusually deep fit of depression. For a time it had seemed to her
      hopeless to try to find another confidante in that class which despised
      and shrank from her. Then Miss Tabitha&rsquo;s pleasant words and transparent
      good-heartedness had lifted her out of her despondency, and she was almost
      resolved now to approach her on the subject of the house iii the back
      yard.

      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;A GRACIOUS FRIEND RAISED UP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he opportunity
      which Jessica sought came with unlooked-for promptness&mdash;in fact,
      before she had quite resolved what to ask for, and how best to prefer her
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a warm, sunny winter morning, with an atmosphere which suggested
      the languor of May rather than the eagerness of early spring, and which
      was already in these few matutinal hours playing havoc with the snowbanks.
      The effects of the thaw were unpleasantly visible on the sidewalks, where
      deep puddles were forming as the drifts melted away, and the back yard was
      one large expanse of treacherous slush. Jessica had hoped that her father
      would come, in order that he might cut away the ice and snow in front, and
      thus drain the walk for passers-by. But as the mild morning air rendered
      it unnecessary to seek the comfort of a seat by the stove, Ben preferred
      to lounge about on the outskirts of the hay-market, exchanging indolent
      jokes with kindred idlers, and vaguely enjoying the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samantha, however, chose this forenoon for her first visit to the
      milliner&rsquo;s shop, and showed a disposition to make herself very much at
      home. The fact that encouragement was plainly wanting did not in any way
      abash her. Lucinda told her flatly that she had only come to see what she
      could pick up, and charged her to her face with having instigated her
      friends to offer them annoyance and affront. Samantha denied both
      imputations with fervor, the while she tried on before the mirror a
      bronze-velvet toque with sage-green feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ever quite believed that of you, Samantha,&rdquo; said
      Jessica, turning from her dismayed contemplation of the water on the
      sidewalk. &ldquo;And if you really want to be friendly, why, you are welcome to
      come here. But I have heard of things you have said that were not at all
      nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All lies!&rdquo; remarked Samantha, studying the effect of the hat as nearly in
      a profile view as she could manage with a single glass. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t believe
      a word you hear here in Thessaly. Wouldn&rsquo;t this go better if there was
      some yellow put in there, close by the feathers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it,&rdquo; said Jessica. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done you any
      harm, and never wished anything but well by you, and I couldn&rsquo;t see why
      you should want to injure me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you they lied?&rdquo; responded Samantha, affably. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cindy, here,
      is always blackguarding me. You know you always did,&rdquo; she added, in
      passing comment upon Lucinda&rsquo;s indignant snort, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t bear no
      malice. It ain&rsquo;t my nature to. I suppose a hat like this comes pretty
      high, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, a sleigh was driven up with some difficulty through the
      yielding snowbanks, and stopped close to the sidewalk in front of the
      shop. It was by far the most distinguished-looking sleigh Jessica had seen
      in Thessaly. The driver on the front seat bore a cockade proudly in his
      high hat, and the horses he controlled were superbly matched creatures,
      with glossy silver-mounted harness, and with tails neatly braided and tied
      up in ribbons for protection from the slush. A costly silver-fox wrap
      depended over the back of the cutter, and a robe of some darker but
      equally sumptuous fur enfolded the two ladies who sat in the second seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica was glad that so splendid an equipage should have drawn up at her
      door, with a new-born commercial instinct, even before she recognized
      either occupant of the sleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Kate Minster,&rdquo; said Samantha, still with the hat of her dreams on
      her head, &ldquo;the handsomest girl in Thessaly, and the richest, and the
      stuck-up-edest. Cracky! but you&rsquo;re in luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica did not know much about the Minsters, but she now saw that the
      other lady, who was already preparing to descend, and stood poised on the
      rail of the cutter looking timorously at the water on the walk, was no
      other than Miss Tabitha Wilcox.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned with quick decision to Samantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you that hat you&rsquo;ve got on,&rdquo; she said in a hurried tone, &ldquo;if
      you&rsquo;ll go with Lucinda clear back into the kitchen and shut both doors
      tight after you, and stay there till I call you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this considerable sacrifice the store was cleared for the reception of
      these visitors&mdash;the most important who had as yet crossed its
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Tabitha did not offer to introduce her companion&mdash;whom Jessica
      noted furtively as a tall, stately, dark girl, with a wonderfully handsome
      face, who stood silently by the little showcase and was wrapped in furs
      worth the whole stock of millinery she confronted&mdash;but bustled about
      the store, while she plunged into the middle of an explanation about hats
      she had had, hats she thought of having, and hats she might have had, of
      which the milliner understood not a word. It was not, indeed, essential
      that she should, for presently Tabitha stopped short, looked about her
      triumphantly, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, wasn&rsquo;t I right? Aren&rsquo;t they the nicest in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall girl smiled, and inclined her dignified head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very pretty, indeed,&rdquo; she answered, and Jessica remarked to
      herself what a soft, rich voice it was, that made even those commonplace
      words so delightful to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we wanted to look at anything in particular,&rdquo; rattled
      on Miss Tabitha. &ldquo;We were driving by&rdquo; (O Tabitha! as if Miss Kate had not
      commanded this excursion for no other purpose than this visit!) &ldquo;and I
      just thought we&rsquo;d drop in, for I&rsquo;ve been telling Miss Minster about what
      excellent taste you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A momentary pause ensued, and then Jessica, conscious of blushes and
      confusion, made bold to unburden her mind of its plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to speak to you,&rdquo; she said, falteringly at first, but with a
      resolution to have it all out, &ldquo;about that vacant house in the back yard
      here. It looks as if it had been a carpenter&rsquo;s shop last, and it seems in
      very bad repair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it might as well come down,&rdquo; broke in Miss Wilcox. &ldquo;Still, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! that wasn&rsquo;t what I meant!&rdquo; protested Jessica. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted
      to propose something about it to you. If&mdash;if you will be seated, I
      can explain what I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies took chairs, but with a palpable accession of reserve on
      their countenances. The girl went on to explain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with, the factory-girls and sewing-girls here spend too much
      time on the streets&mdash;I suppose it is so everywhere&mdash;the girls
      who were thrown out when the match factory shut down, particularly. What
      else can they do? There is no other place. Then they get into trouble, or
      at any rate they learn slangy talk and coarse ways. But you can&rsquo;t blame
      them, for their homes, when they have any, are not pleasant places, and
      where they hire rooms it is almost worse still. Now, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of
      something&mdash;or, rather, it isn&rsquo;t my own idea, but I&rsquo;ll speak about
      that later on. This is the idea: I have come to know a good many of the
      best of these girls&mdash;perhaps you would think they were the worst,
      too, but they&rsquo;re not&mdash;and I know they would be glad of some good
      place where they could spend their evenings, especially in the winter,
      where it would be cosey and warm, and they could read or talk, or bring
      their own sewing for themselves, and amuse themselves as they liked. And I
      had thought that perhaps that old house could be fixed up so as to serve,
      and they could come through the shop here after tea, and so I could keep
      track of them, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite think I do,&rdquo; said Miss Tabitha, with distinct
      disapprobation. The other lady said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica felt her heart sink. The plan had seemed so excellent to her, and
      yet it was to be frowned down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I haven&rsquo;t made it clear to you,&rdquo; she ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you have,&rdquo; replied Miss Tabitha. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind pulling the house
      down, but to make it a rendezvous for all the tag-rag and bob-tail in town&mdash;I
      simply couldn&rsquo;t think of it! These houses along here have seen their best
      days, perhaps, but they&rsquo;ve all been respectable, always!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think myself that you have quite grasped Miss Lawton&rsquo;s meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the low, full, quiet voice of the beautiful fur-clad lady that
      spoke, and Jessica looked at her with tears of anxious gratitude in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minster seemed to avoid returning the glance, but went on in the same
      even, musical tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me that there might be a great deal of much-needed good
      done in just that way, Tabitha. The young lady says&mdash;I think I
      understood her to say&mdash;that she had talked with some of these girls,
      and that that is what they would like. It seems to me only common-sense,
      if you want to help people, to help them in their own way, and not insist,
      instead, that it shall be in your way&mdash;which really is no help at
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can say, I hope, that I have ever declined to extend a helping
      hand to anybody who showed a proper spirit,&rdquo; said Miss Wilcox, with
      dignity, putting up her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; pleaded Jessica. &ldquo;That is why I felt sure you would
      like my plan. I ought to tell you&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t quite my plan. It was
      Mrs. Fairchild, at Tecumseh, who used to teach the Burfield school, who
      suggested it. She is a very, very good woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think it is a very, very good idea,&rdquo; said Miss Kate, speaking for
      the first time directly to Jessica. &ldquo;Of course, there would have to be
      safeguards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no conception what a rough lot they are,&rdquo; said Miss Tabitha, in
      more subdued protest. &ldquo;There is no telling who they would bring here, or
      what they wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I am sure all that could be taken care of,&rdquo; urged Jessica, taking
      fresh courage, and speaking now to both her visitors. &ldquo;Only those whom I
      knew to mean well by the undertaking should be made members, and they
      would agree to very strict rules, I feel certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, child alive! where would you get the money for it, even if it could
      be done otherwise?&rdquo; Miss Tabitha wagged her curls conclusively, but her
      smile was not unkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be exact to say that Jessica had not considered this, but, as
      it was now presented, it seemed like a new proposition. She was not ready
      to answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wilcox did not wait over long for a reply, but proceeded to point
      out, in a large and exhaustive way, the financial impossibilities of the
      plan. Jessica had neither heart nor words for an interruption, and Miss
      Kate listened in an absent-minded manner, her eyes on the plumes and
      velvets in the showcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interruption did come in a curiously unexpected fashion. A loud
      stamping of wet feet was heard on the step outside; then the door from the
      street was opened. The vehemence of the call-bell&rsquo;s clamor seemed to
      dismay the visitor, or perhaps it was the presence of the ladies. At all
      events, he took off his hat, as if it had been a parlor instead of a shop,
      and made an awkward inclusive bow, reaching one hand back for the latch,
      as if minded to beat a retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Tracy!&rdquo; exclaimed Tabitha, rising from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben advanced now and shook hands with both her and Jessica. For an
      instant the silence threatened to be embarrassing, and it was not wholly
      relieved when Tabitha presented him to Miss Minster, and that young lady
      bowed formally without moving in her chair. But the lawyer could not
      suspect the disagreeable thoughts which were chasing one another behind
      these two unruffled and ladylike fronts, and it was evident enough that
      his coming was welcome to the mistress of the little shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wanted to look in upon you before,&rdquo; he said to Jessica, &ldquo;and I am
      ashamed to think that I haven&rsquo;t done so. I have been very much occupied
      with other matters. It doesn&rsquo;t excuse me to myself, but it may to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; Jessica answered, and then realized how
      miserably inadequate the words were. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to come at
      all,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabitha shot a swift glance at her companion, and the two ladies rose, as
      by some automatic mechanical device, absolutely together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be going, Miss Lawton,&rdquo; said the old maid, primly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s intuition told Jessica that something had gone wrong. If she did
      not entirely guess the nature of the trouble, it became clear enough on
      the instant to her that these ladies misinterpreted Reuben&rsquo;s visit.
      Perhaps they did not like him&mdash;or perhaps&mdash;She stepped toward
      them and spoke eagerly, before she had followed out this second hypothesis
      in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have a moment&rsquo;s time to spare,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;I <i>wish</i> you
      would let me explain to Mr. Tracy the plan I have talked over with you. He
      was my school-teacher; he is my oldest friend&mdash;the only friend I had
      when I was&mdash;a&mdash;a girl, and I haven&rsquo;t seen him before since the
      day I arrived home here. I should <i>so</i> much like to have you hear his
      opinion. The lady I spoke of&mdash;Mrs. Fairchild&mdash;wrote to him about
      me. Perhaps he knows of the plan already from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben did not know of the plan, and the two ladies consented to take
      seats again while it should be explained to him. Tabitha assumed a distant
      and uneasy expression of countenance, and looked straight ahead of her out
      through the glass door until the necessity for relief by conversation
      swelled up within her to bursting point; for Kate had rather flippantly
      deserted her, and so far from listening with haughty reserve under
      protest, had actually joined in the talk, and taken up the thread of
      Jessica&rsquo;s stumbling explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three young people seemed to get on extremely well together. Reuben
      fired up with enthusiasm at the first mention of the plan, and showed so
      plainly the sincerity of his liking for it that Miss Minster felt herself,
      too, all aglow with zeal. Thus taken up by friendly hands, the project
      grew apace, and took on form and shape like Aladdin&rsquo;s palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabitha listened with a swiftly mounting impatience of her speechless
      condition, and a great sickening of the task of watching the cockade of
      the coachman outside, which she had imposed upon herself, as the talk went
      on. She heard Reuben say that he would gladly raise a subscription for the
      work; she heard Kate ask to be allowed to head the list with whatever sum
      he thought best, and then to close the list with whatever additional sum
      was needed to make good the total amount required; she heard Jessica,
      overcome with delight, stammer out thanks for this unlooked-for adoption
      and endowment of her poor little plan, and then she could stand it no
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you quite settled what you will do with my house?&rdquo; she asked, still
      keeping her face toward the door. &ldquo;There are some other places along here
      belonging to me&mdash;that is, they always have up to now&mdash;but of
      course if you have plans about them, too, just tell me, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Tabitha,&rdquo; said Miss Minster, rising from her chair as
      she spoke. &ldquo;Of course we took your assent for granted from the start. I
      believe, candidly, that you are more enthusiastic about it this moment
      than even we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben thought that the old lady dissembled her enthusiasm skilfully, but
      at least she offered no dissent. A few words more were exchanged, the
      lawyer promising again his aid, and Miss Minster insisting that she
      herself wanted the task of drawing up, in all its details, the working
      plan for the new institution, and, on second thoughts, would prefer to pay
      for it all herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been simply famishing for something to do all these years,&rdquo; she
      said, in smiling confidence, to Tracy, &ldquo;and here it is at last. You can&rsquo;t
      guess how happy I shall be in mapping out the whole thing&mdash;rules and
      amusements and the arrangements of the rooms and the furnishing, and&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Jessicas face expressed too plainly the thought that this bantling
      of hers, which had been so munificently adopted, bade fair to be taken
      away from her altogether, for Miss Minster added: &ldquo;Of course, when the
      sketch is fairly well completed, I will show it to <i>you</i>, and we will
      advise together,&rdquo; and Jessica smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two ladies were seated again in the sleigh, and the horses had
      pranced their way through the wet snow up to the beaten track once more,
      Miss Tabitha said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew a girl to run on so in all my born days. Here you are,
      seeing these two people for the very first time half an hour ago, and
      you&rsquo;ve tied yourself up to goodness only knows what. One would think you&rsquo;d
      known them all your life, the way you said ditto to every random thing
      that popped into their heads. And a pretty penny they&rsquo;ll make it cost you,
      too! And what will your mother say?&rdquo; Miss Minster smiled good-naturedly,
      and patted her companion&rsquo;s gloved hand with her own. &ldquo;Never you worry,
      Tabitha,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk, please, for a minute. I want to
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a very long minute. The young heiress spent it in gazing
      abstractedly at the buttons on the coachman&rsquo;s back, and the rapt
      expression on her face seemed to tell more of a pleasant day-dream than of
      serious mental travail. Miss Wilcox was accustomed to these moods which
      called for silence, and offered no protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Kate spoke, with a tone of affectionate command. &ldquo;When we get to
      the house I will give you a book to read, and I want you to finish every
      word of it before you begin anything else. It is called &lsquo;All Sorts and
      Conditions of Men,&rsquo; and it tells how a lovely girl with whole millions of
      pounds did good in England, and I was thinking of it all the while we sat
      there in the shop. Only the mortification of it is, that in the book the
      rich girl originated the idea herself, whereas I had to have it hammered
      into my head by&mdash;by others. But you must read the book, and hurry
      with it, because&mdash;or no: I will get another copy to read again
      myself. And I will buy other copies; one for <i>her</i> and one <i>for him</i>,
      and one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lapsed suddenly into silence again. The disparity between the
      stupendous dream out of which the People&rsquo;s Palace for East London&rsquo;s mighty
      hive of millions has been evolved, and the humble project of a
      sitting-room or two for the factory-girls of a village, rose before her
      vision, and had the effect of making her momentarily ridiculous in her own
      eyes. The familiarity, too, with which she had labelled these two
      strangers, this lawyer and this milliner, in her own thoughts, as &ldquo;him&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;her,&rdquo; jarred just a little upon her maidenly consciousness. Perhaps
      she had rushed to embrace their scheme with too much avidity. It was
      generally her fault to be over-impetuous. Had she been so in this case?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, what we can do here&rdquo;&mdash;she began with less eagerness of
      tone, thinking aloud rather than addressing Tabitha&mdash;&ldquo;must at best be
      on a very small scale. You must not be frightened by the book, where
      everything is done with fairy prodigality, and the lowest figures dealt
      with are hundreds of thousands. I only want you to read it that you may
      catch the spirit of it, and so understand how I feel. And you needn&rsquo;t
      worry about my wasting money, or doing anything foolish, you dear, timid
      old soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wilcox, in her revolving mental processes, had somehow veered around
      to an attitude of moderate sympathy with the project, the while she
      listened to these words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t, my dear,&rdquo; she replied, quite
      sweetly. &ldquo;And I daresay there can really be a great deal of good done,
      only, of course, it will have to be gone at cautiously and by degrees. And
      we must let old Runkle do the papering and whitewashing; don&rsquo;t forget
      that. He&rsquo;s had ever so much sickness in his family all the winter, and
      work is so slack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I like your Mr. Tracy!&rdquo; was Kate&rsquo;s irrelevant reply. She
      made it musingly, as if the idea were new to her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see for yourself there couldn&rsquo;t have been anything at all in that
      spiteful Sarah Cheese-borough&rsquo;s talk about him and her,&rdquo; said Tabitha, who
      now felt herself to have been all along the champion of this injured
      couple. &ldquo;How on earth a respectable woman can invent such slanders beats
      my comprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate Minster laughed merrily aloud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky you weren&rsquo;t made of
      pancake batter, Tabitha,&rdquo; she said with mock gravity; &ldquo;for, if you had
      been, you never could have stood this being stirred both ways. You would
      have turned heavy and been spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of which I live to spoil other people, eh?&rdquo; purred the gratified
      old lady, shaking her curls with affectionate pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we weren&rsquo;t out in the street, I believe I should kiss you, Tabitha,&rdquo;
       said the girl. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t begin to imagine how delightfully you have
      behaved today!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;TRACY HEARS STRANGE THINGS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>EUBEN&rsquo;S first
      impulse, when he found himself alone in the little shop with his former
      pupil, was to say good-by and get out as soon as he could. To the best of
      his recollection, he had never before been in a store consecrated entirely
      to the fashions and finery of the opposite sex, and he was oppressed by a
      sense of being an intruder upon an exclusively feminine domain. The young
      girl, too, whom he had been thinking of all this while as an unfortunate
      child whom he must watch over and be good to, stood revealed before him as
      a self-controlled and sophisticated woman, only a few years younger than
      himself in actual age, and much wiser than himself in the matters of
      head-gear and textures and colors which belonged to this place. He could
      have talked freely to her in his law-office, with his familiar accessories
      of papers and books about him. A background of bonnets was disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful she is!&rdquo; were Jessica&rsquo;s first words, and they pleasurably
      startled the lawyer from his embarrassed revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is, indeed,&rdquo; he answered, and somehow found himself hoping that the
      conversation would cling to this subject a good while. &ldquo;I had never met
      her before, as you saw, but of course I have known her by sight a long
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw her before to-day,&rdquo; said Jessica. &ldquo;How wonderful
      it seems that she should have come, and then that you came, too, and that
      you both should like the plan, and take it up so, and make a success of it
      right at the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben smiled. &ldquo;In your eagerness to keep up with the procession I fear
      you are getting ahead of the band,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t quite call it a
      success, at present. But, no doubt, it&rsquo;s a great thing to have her
      enlisted in it. I&rsquo;m glad she likes you; her friendship will make all the
      difference in the world to you, here in Thessaly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not immediately answer, and Tracy, looking at her as she
      walked across to the showcase, was surprised to catch the glisten of tears
      on her eyelashes. He had no idea what to say, but waited in pained
      puzzlement for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Friendship&rsquo; is not quite the word,&rdquo; she said at last, looking up at him
      and smiling with mournful softness through her tears. &ldquo;I shall be glad if
      she likes me&mdash;as you say, it will be a great thing if she helps me&mdash;but
      we shall hardly be &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; you know. <i>She</i> would never call it
      that. Oh, no! oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trembled audibly over these last words, and she began hurriedly
      to re-arrange some of the articles in the showcase, with the obvious
      design of masking her emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do yourself no greater harm than by exaggerating that kind of
      notion, my girl,&rdquo; said Reuben Tracy, in his old gravely kind voice. &ldquo;You
      would put thoughts into her head that way which she had never dreamt of
      otherwise; that is, if she weren&rsquo;t a good and sensible person. Why, she is
      a woman like yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no! <i>Not</i> like <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was infinitely touched by the pathos of this deprecating wail, but
      he went on as if he had not heard it: &ldquo;A woman like yourself, with a heart
      turned in mercy and charity toward other women who are not so strong to
      help themselves. Why on earth should you vex your soul with fears that she
      will be unkind to you, when she showed you as plain as the noonday sun her
      desire <i>to</i> be kind? You mustn&rsquo;t yield to such fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind, yes! But you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> understand. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have spoken as I did. It was a mere question of a word, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica smiled again, to show that, though the tears were still there, the
      grief behind them was to be regarded as gone, and added, &ldquo;Yes, she was
      kindness itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very rich in her own right, I believe, and if her interest in your
      project is genuine&mdash;that is, of the kind that lasts&mdash;you will
      hardly need any other assistance. Of course you must allow for the chance
      of her dropping the idea as suddenly as she picked it up. Rich women&mdash;rich
      people generally, for that matter&mdash;are often flighty about such
      things. &lsquo;Put not your trust in princes,&rsquo; serves as a warning about
      millionnaires as well as monarchs. The rest of us are forced to be more or
      less continuous in what we think and do. We have to keep at the things
      we&rsquo;ve started, because a waste of time would be serious to us. We have to
      keep the friends and associates we&rsquo;ve got, because others are not to be
      had for the asking. But these favored people are more free&mdash;their
      time doesn&rsquo;t matter, and they can find new sets of friends ready made
      whenever they weary of the others. Still, let us hope she will be
      steadfast. She has a strong face, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had listened to this substantial dissertation with more or less
      comprehension, but with unbounded respect. Anything that Reuben Tracy said
      she felt must be good. Besides, his conclusion jumped with her hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of her losing interest in the thing itself,&rdquo; she answered.
      &ldquo;What worries me is&mdash;or, no&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped herself with a smile,
      and made haste to add, &ldquo;I forgot. I mustn&rsquo;t be worried. But who is our
      Miss Minster? Does she own the ironworks? Tell me about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She owns a share of the works, I think. I don&rsquo;t know how big a share, or,
      in fact, much else about her. I&rsquo;ve heard my partner, Horace Boyce, talk
      lately a good deal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tracy did not finish his sentence, for Jessica had sunk suddenly into the
      chair behind the case, and was staring at him over the glass-bound row of
      bonnets with wide-open, startled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your partner!</i> Yours, did you say? That man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone and manner very much surprised Reuben. &ldquo;Why, yes, he&rsquo;s my
      partner,&rdquo; he said, slowly and in wonderment. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that? We&rsquo;ve
      been together since December.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and murmured something hastily about having been very
      busy, and being cooped up on a back street.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not explain her agitation, which more and more puzzled Reuben as
      he thought upon it. He stood looking down upon her where she sat, and
      noted that her face, though it was turned away from him now, was both pale
      and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; he asked finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head again, and the lawyer fancied she was biting her lips.
      He did not know well what else to say, and was speculating whether it
      would not be best to say nothing, when all at once she burst forth
      vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> lie to you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I <i>did</i> know him, very
      much to my cost. And, oh! don&rsquo;t you trust him! Don&rsquo;t you trust him, I say!
      He&rsquo;s not fit to be with you. Oh, my God!&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t</i> I know Horace
      Boyce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben stood silent, still looking down gravely into the girl&rsquo;s flashing
      eyes. What she had said annoyed and disturbed him, but what he thought
      chiefly about was how to avoid bringing on an explanation which must wound
      and humiliate her feelings. It was clear enough what she meant, and he
      compassionately hoped she would not feel it necessary to add anything.
      Above all things he felt that he wanted to spare her pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said at last, as the frankest way out of the dilemma.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more.&rdquo; He pondered for a minute or so upon the propriety of
      not saying anything more himself, and then with decision offered her his
      hand across the showcase, and held hers in his expansive clasp with what
      he took to be fatherly sympathy, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go now. Good-by. And I shall hear from you soon about the
      project?&rdquo; He smiled to reassure her, and added, still holding her hand,
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you let worry come inside these doors at all. You have made a
      famous start, and everything will go well, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went out, and the shrill clamor of the bell hung to jangle when
      the door was opened woke Jessica from her day-dream, just as the sunbeams
      had begun to drive away the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose with a start, and walked to the door to follow his retiring
      figure through the glass. She stood there, lost in another revery&mdash;vague,
      languorous, half-bright, half-hideous&mdash;until the door from the back
      room was opened, and Samantha&rsquo;s sharp voice fell on the silence of the
      little shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to set in that poky old kitchen any longer for all the
      bonnets in your whole place,&rdquo; she remarked, with determination, advancing
      to the mirror with the toque on her truculently poised head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, you said you&rsquo;d call us when they were all gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda stole up to her sister-employer, and murmured in a side-long
      whisper: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t keep her from listening a little. You talked too
      loud. She heard what you said about that Boyce chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tidings angered Jessica even more than they alarmed her. With an
      impulse equally illogical and natural, she frowned at Samantha, and
      stiffened her fingers claw-wise, with a distinct itching to tear that
      arrangement of bronze velvet and sage-green feathers from her perfidious
      sister&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, it was the usually aggressive Lucinda who counselled
      prudence. &ldquo;If I was you, I&rsquo;d ask her to stay to dinner,&rdquo; she said, in the
      same furtive undertone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to her, and I guess she&rsquo;ll be
      all right if we make it kind o&rsquo; pleasant for her when she comes. But if
      you rub her the wrong way, she&rsquo;ll scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samantha was asked to dinner, and stayed, and later, being offered her
      choice of three hat-pins with heads of ornamented jet, took two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben walked slowly back to the office, and then sat through a solitary
      meal at a side-table in the Dearborn House dining-room, although his
      customary seat was at the long table down the centre, in order that he
      might think over what he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not clear that the isolated fact disclosed to him in the milliner&rsquo;s
      shop would, in itself, have been sufficient to awaken in his mind any
      serious distrust of his partner. As the sexes have different trainings and
      different spheres, so they have different standards. Men set up the bars,
      for instance, against a brother who cheats at cards, or divulges what he
      has heard in his club, or borrows money which he cannot repay, or pockets
      cigars at feasts when he does not himself smoke. But their courts of
      ethics do not exercise jurisdiction over sentimental or sexual offences,
      as a rule. These the male instinct vaguely refers to some other tribunal,
      which may or may not be in session somewhere else. And this male instinct
      is not necessarily co-existent with immoral tendencies, or blunted
      sensibilities, or even indifference: it is the man&rsquo;s way of looking at it&mdash;just
      as it is his way to cross a muddy street on his toes, while his sisters
      perform the same feat on their heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben Tracy was a good man, and one with keen aspirations toward
      honorable and ennobling things; but still he was a man, and it may be that
      this discovery, standing by itself, would not seriously have affected his
      opinion of Horace. But it did not stand by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an indefinite kind of way, he was conscious of being less attracted by
      the wit and sparkling smalltalk of Horace than he had been at first.
      Somehow, the young man seemed to have exhausted his store; he began to
      repeat himself, as if he had already made the circuit of the small ring
      around which his mind travelled. Reuben confronted a suspicion that the
      Boyce soil was shallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might not be necessarily an evil thing, he said to himself. Lawyers
      quite often achieved notable successes before juries, who were not deep or
      well-grounded men. Horace was versatile, and versatility was a quality
      which Reuben distinctly lacked. From that point of view the combination
      ought, therefore, to be of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, then, Horace told lies. Versatility of that variety was not so
      admirable. There could be no doubt on this point. Reuben could count on
      his fingers now six separate falsehoods that his partner had already told
      him. They happened not to be upon vital or even important subjects, but
      that did not render them the more palatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was the Minster business. He knew from other sources that
      Horace had been intrusted with the papers left to Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s executors.
      The young man had taken them to his father&rsquo;s house, and had never
      mentioned so much as a syllable about them to his partner. No doubt,
      Horace felt that he ought to have this as his personal business, and upon
      the precedent Reuben himself had set with the railroad work, this was fair
      enough. But there was something underhanded in his secrecy about the
      matter. He should have spoken of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben&rsquo;s thoughts from this drifted to the Minsters themselves, and
      centred reverently upon the luminous figure of that elder daughter whom he
      had met an hour before. He did not dwell much upon her beauty&mdash;perhaps
      he was a trifle dull about such things&mdash;but her graciousness, her
      sweet interest in the charity, her womanly commingling of softness and
      enthusiasm, seemed to shine about him as he mused. Thessaly unconsciously
      assumed a brighter and more wholesome aspect, with much less need of
      reform than before, in his mind&rsquo;s eye, now that he thought of it as her
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her home! The prosperous and respected lawyer was still a country boy in
      his unformed speculations as to what that home might be like. The Minster
      house was the most splendid mansion in Dearborn County, it was said, but
      his experience with mansions was small. A hundred times it had been said
      to him that he could go anywhere if he liked, and he gave the statement
      credence enough. But somehow it happened that he had not gone. To &ldquo;be in
      society,&rdquo; as the phrase went, had not seemed important to him. Now, almost
      for the first time, he found himself regretting this. Then he smiled
      somewhat scowlingly at his plate as the vagrant reflection came up that
      his partner contributed social status as well as versatility and mendacity
      to the outfit of the firm. Horace Boyce had a swallowtail coat, and
      visited at the Minsters&rsquo;. The reflection was not altogether grateful to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben rose from the table, and stood for a few moments by the window
      overlooking the veranda and the side street. The sunny warmth of the
      thawing noon-day had made it possible to have the window open, and the
      sound of voices close at hand showed that there were people already
      anticipating pneumonia and the springtime by sitting on the porch outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      These voices conveyed no distinct impression at first to Reuben&rsquo;s mind,
      busy as he was with his own reflections. But all at once there was a
      scraping of feet and chair-legs on the floor, signifying that the party
      had risen, and then he heard two remarks which made a sharp appeal to his
      attention and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first voice said: &ldquo;Mind, I&rsquo;m not going to let you put me into a hole.
      What I do, I do only when it has been proved to me to be to my own
      interest, and not at all because I&rsquo;m afraid of you. Understand that
      clearly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other voice replied: &ldquo;All that you need be afraid of is that you will
      kick over your own bucket of milk. You&rsquo;ve got the whole game in your
      hands, if you only listen to me and don&rsquo;t play it like a fool. What do you
      say? Shall we go up to your house and put the thing into shape? We can be
      alone there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voices ceased, and there was a sound of footsteps descending from the
      porch to the sidewalk. The two men passed before the window, ducking their
      heads for protection against the water dripping from the overflowed eaves
      on the roof of the veranda, and thus missing sight of the man who had
      overheard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben had known at once by the sound of the voice that the first speaker
      was Horace Boyce. He recognized his companion now as Schuyler Tenney, and
      the sight startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just why it should have done so, he could not have explained. He had seen
      this Schuyler Tenney almost every day for a good many years, putting them
      all together, and had never before been troubled, much less alarmed, by
      the spectacle. But coming now upon what Jessica had told him, and what his
      own thoughts had evolved, and what he had inadvertently overheard, the
      figure of the rising hardware merchant loomed darkly in his perturbed
      fancy as an evil and threatening thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rustic client with a grievance sought Tracy out in the seclusion of the
      dining-room, and dragged him back to his office and into the intricacies
      of the law of trespass; but though he did his best to listen and
      understand, the farmer went away feeling that his lawyer was a
      considerably overrated man.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, strive as he might, Reuben could not get the sound of those words,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got the whole game in your hands,&rdquo; out of his ears, or restrain
      his mind from wearying itself with the anxious puzzle of guessing what
      that game could be.

      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;A SIMPLE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Schuyler Tenney
      had never before been afforded an opportunity of studying a young
      gentleman of fashion and culture in the intimacy of his private
      apartments, and he looked about Horace&rsquo;s room with lively curiosity and
      interest, when the two conspirators had entered the General&rsquo;s house, gone
      up-stairs, and shut doors behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like a ninety-nine-cent store, for all the world,&rdquo; was his
      comment when he had examined the bric-à-brac on the walls and mantels,
      &ldquo;hefted&rdquo; a bronze trifle or two on the table, and taken a comprehensive
      survey of the furniture and hangings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather bare than otherwise,&rdquo; said Horace, carelessly. &ldquo;I got a
      tolerably decent lot of traps together when I had rooms in Jermyn Street,
      but I had to let most of them go when I pulled up stakes to come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German Street? I suppose that is in Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Sold &rsquo;em because you got hard up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. But this damned tariff of yours&mdash;or ours&mdash;makes it
      cost too much to bring decent things over here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Protection to American industry, my boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Tenney, affably. &ldquo;We
      couldn&rsquo;t get on a fortnight without it. Just think what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it all, man! We didn&rsquo;t come here to talk tariff!&rdquo; Horace broke
      in, with a smile which was half annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented Mr. Tenney, settling himself in the low,
      deep-backed easy-chair, and putting the tips of his lean fingers together.
      &ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t, for a fact.&rdquo; He added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause: &ldquo;I guess
      I&rsquo;ll have to rig up a room like this myself, when the thing comes off.&rdquo; He
      smiled icily to himself at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, let us talk about the &lsquo;thing,&rsquo; as you call it. Will you have a
      drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never touch it,&rdquo; said Mr. Tenney, and he looked curiously on while Horace
      poured out some brandy, and then opened a bottle of soda-water to go with
      it. He was particularly impressed by the little wire frame-work stand made
      to hold the round-bottomed bottle, and asked its cost, and wondered if
      they wouldn&rsquo;t be a good thing to keep in the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now to business!&rdquo; said Horace, dragging out from under a sofa the black
      tin box which held the Minster papers, and throwing back its cover. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      told you pretty well what there is in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney took from his pocket-book the tabular statement Horace had made
      of the Minster property, and smoothed it out over his pointed knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very pretty table,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no bookkeeper could have done it
      better. I know it by heart, but we&rsquo;ll keep it here in sight while you
      proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for me to proceed with,&rdquo; said Horace, lolling back in his
      chair in turn. &ldquo;I want to hear <i>you!</i> Don&rsquo;t let us waste time.
      Broadly, what do you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broadly, what does everybody propose? To get for himself what somebody
      else has got. That&rsquo;s human nature. It&rsquo;s every kind of nature, down to the
      little chickens just hatched who start to chase the chap with the worm in
      his mouth before they&rsquo;ve fairly got their tails out of the shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to write a book, Schuyler,&rdquo; said Horace, using this familiar
      name for the first time: &ldquo;&lsquo;Tenney on Dynamic Sociology&rsquo;! But I interrupted
      your application. What particular worm have you got in your bill&rsquo;s eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all worms, so the Bible says. I suppose even those scrumptious
      ladies there come under that head, like we ordinary mortals.&rdquo; Mr. Tenney
      pointed his agreeable metaphor by touching the paper on his knee with his
      joined finger-tips, and showed his small, sharpened teeth in a momentary
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I follow you,&rdquo; said Horace, tentatively. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a heap of money that you&rsquo;ve ciphered out there, on that paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. True, it isn&rsquo;t ours, and we&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with it. But that&rsquo;s
      a detail. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good deal of it can be ours, if you&rsquo;ve got the pluck to go in with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace frowned. &ldquo;Upon my word, Tenney,&rdquo; he said, impatiently, &ldquo;what do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest what I said,&rdquo; was the sententious and collected response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man laughed with an uneasy assumption of scorn. &ldquo;Is it a
      burglary you do me the honor to propose, or only common or garden robbery?
      Ought we to manage a little murder in the thing, or what do you say to
      arson? Upon my word, man, I believe that you don&rsquo;t realize that what
      you&rsquo;ve said is an insult!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; said the hardware merchant, in no wise
      ruffled. &ldquo;But I do realize that you come pretty near being the
      dod-blamedest fool in Dearborn County.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged for the qualification, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; retorted Horace, who felt
      the mists of his half-simulated, half-instinctive anger fading away before
      the steady breath of the other man&rsquo;s purpose. &ldquo;But I interrupt you. Pray
      go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no question of dishonesty about the thing, not the slightest.
      I ain&rsquo;t that kind of a man!&rdquo; Horace permitted himself a shadowy smile,
      emphasized by a subdued little sniff, which Tenney caught and was pleased
      to appear to resent, &ldquo;Thessaly knows me!&rdquo; he said, with an air of pride.
      &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t a living man&mdash;nor a dead one nuther&mdash;can put his
      finger on me. I&rsquo;ve lived aboveboard, sir, and owe no man a red cent, and I
      defy anybody to so much as whisper a word about my character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tenney on Faith Justified by Works,&rsquo;&rdquo; commented Horace, softly, smiling
      as much as he dared, but in a less aggressive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Works&mdash;yes!&rdquo; said the hardware merchant, &ldquo;the Minster iron-works, in
      particular.&rdquo; He seemed pleased with his little joke, and paused to dwell
      upon it in his mind for an instant. Then he went on, sitting upright in
      his chair now, and displaying a new earnestness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dishonesty is wrong, and it is foolish. It gets a man disgraced, and it
      gets him in jail. But commercial acumen is another thing. A smart man can
      get money in a good many ways without giving anybody a chance to call him
      dishonest. I have thought out several plans&mdash;some of them strong at
      one point, others at another, but all pretty middlin&rsquo; good&mdash;how to
      feather our own nests out of this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Horace, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney did not smile any more, and he had done with digressions.
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; he said, with his intent gray eyes fixed on the young
      man&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;what guarantee have I that you won&rsquo;t give me away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What guarantee <i>can</i> I give you?&rdquo; replied Horace, also sitting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; said Tenney, thinking in his own swift-working
      mind that it would be easy enough to take care of this poor creature later
      on. &ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;ve been appointed Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s lawyer in the
      interest of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company&mdash;this company here
      marked &lsquo;D,&rsquo; in which the family has one hundred and seventy-five thousand
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gathered as much. Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind telling me what it is all
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as transparent as plate-glass when I think a man is acting square
      with me,&rdquo; said the hardware merchant. &ldquo;This is how it is. Wendover and me
      got hold of a little rolling-mill and nail-works at Cadmus, down on the
      Southern Tier, a few years ago. Some silly people had put up the money for
      it, and there was a sort of half-crazy inventor fellow running it. They
      were making ducks and drakes of the whole thing, and I saw a chance of
      getting into the concern&mdash;I used to buy a good deal of hardware from
      them, and knew how they stood&mdash;and I spoke to Wendover, and so we
      went in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means that the other people were put out, I suppose,&rdquo; commented
      Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no; but they kind o&rsquo; faded away like. I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly say they
      were put out, but after a while they didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to stay in.
      But never mind them. Well, Cadmus was a bad location. The iron fields
      around there had pretty well petered out, and we were way off the main
      line of transportation. Business was fair enough; we made a straight ten
      per cent, year in and year out, because the thing was managed carefully;
      but that was in spite of a lot of drawbacks. So I got a scheme in my head
      to move the whole concern up here to Thessaly, and hitch it up with the
      Minster iron-works. We could save one dollar a ton, or forty-five thousand
      dollars in all, in the mere matter of freight alone, if we could use up
      their entire output. I may tell you, I didn&rsquo;t appear in the business at
      all. I daresay Mrs. Minster don&rsquo;t know to this day that I&rsquo;m a kind of
      partner of hers. It happened that Wendover used to know her when she was a
      girl&mdash;they both come from down the Hudson somewhere&mdash;and so he
      worked the thing with her, and we moved over from Cadmus, hook, line, bob,
      and sinker, and we&rsquo;re the Thessaly Manufacturing Company. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, yes. She and her daughters have one hundred and seventy-five
      thousand dollars cash in it. What is the rest of the company like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stocked at four hundred thousand dollars. We put in all our plant
      and machinery and business and good-will and so on at one hundred and
      fifty thousand dollars, and then we furnished seventy-five thousand
      dollars cash. So we hold two hundred and twenty-five shares to their one
      hundred and seventy-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pete Wendover and me are about the only people you&rsquo;re liable to
      meet around the premises, I guess. There are some other names on the
      books, but they don&rsquo;t amount to much. We can wipe them off whenever we
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice that this company has paid no dividends since it was formed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because of the expense of building. And we ain&rsquo;t got what you may
      call fairly to work yet. But it&rsquo;s all right. There is big money in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; observed Horace. &ldquo;But, if you will excuse the remark, I seem
      to have missed that part of your statement which referred to <i>my</i>
      making something out of the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hardware merchant allowed his cold eyes to twinkle for an instant.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be taken care of,&rdquo; he said, confidentially. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret your
      gizzard about <i>that!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace smiled. It seemed to be easier to get on with Tenney than he had
      thought. &ldquo;But what am I to do; that is, if I decide to do anything?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t see your scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; said the other, with an air of candor. &ldquo;And you
      lawyers have the name of being so &rsquo;cute, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we see through a stone wall much farther than other
      people. Our chief advantage is in being able to recognize that it is a
      wall. And this one of yours seems to be as thick and opaque as most, I&rsquo;m
      bound to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to do anything, just now,&rdquo; Mr. Tenney explained.
      &ldquo;Things may turn up in which you can be of assistance, and then we want to
      count on you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a far less lucid explanation than Horace had looked for. Tenney
      had been so anxious for a confidential talk, and had hinted of such
      dazzling secrets, that this was a distinct disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean by saying that I had the whole game in my hands?&rdquo; he
      demanded, not dissembling his annoyance. &ldquo;Thus far, you haven&rsquo;t even dealt
      me any cards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney lay back in his chair again, and surveyed Horace over his
      finger-tips. &ldquo;There is to be a game, young man, and you&rsquo;ve been put in a
      position to play in it when the time comes. But I should be a particularly
      simple kind of goose to tell you about it beforehand; now, wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus candidly appealed to, Horace could not but admit that his companion&rsquo;s
      caution was defensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;re right enough. I&rsquo;ve got the
      position, as you say. Perhaps it is through you that it came to me; I&rsquo;ll
      concede that, for argument&rsquo;s sake. You are not a man who expects people to
      act from gratitude alone. Therefore you don&rsquo;t count upon my doing things
      for you in this position, even though you put me there, unless you first
      convince me that they will also benefit me. That is clear enough, isn&rsquo;t
      it? Very well; thus the matter stands. When the occasion arises that you
      need me, you can tell me what it is, and what I am to get out of it, and
      then we&rsquo;ll talk business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney had not lifted his eyes for a moment from his companion&rsquo;s face.
      Had his own countenance been one on which inner feelings were easily
      reflected, it would just now have worn an expression of amused contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this much I might as well tell you straight off,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A part
      of my notion, if everything goes smoothly, is to have Mrs. Minster put you
      into the Thessaly Manufacturing Company as her representative and to pay
      you five thousand dollars a year for it, which might be fixed so as to
      stand separate from the other work you do for her. Wendover can arrange
      that with her. And then I am counting now on declaring myself up at the
      Minster works, and putting in my time up there; so that your father will
      be needed again in the store, and it might be so that I could double his
      salary, and let him have back say a half interest in the business, and put
      him on his feet. I say these things <i>might</i> be done. I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve
      settled on them, mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you still think it best to keep me in the dark; not to tell me what
      it is I&rsquo;m to do?&rdquo; Horace leant forward, and asked this question eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you this much. Your business will be to say ditto to
      whatever me and Wendover say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A full minute&rsquo;s pause ensued, during which Mr. Tenney gravely watched
      Horace sip what remained of his drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what shall it be? Do you go in with us?&rdquo; he asked, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better think it over,&rdquo; said Horace. &ldquo;Give me, say, till Monday&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      five days. And of course, if I do say yes, it will be understood that I am
      not to be bound to do anything of a shady character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; but you needn&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; answered Tenney.
      &ldquo;Everything will be as straight as a die. There will be nothing but a
      simple business transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean by saying that we should take some of the Minster money
      away? That had a queer sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All business consists in getting other people&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; said the hardware
      merchant, sententiously. &ldquo;Where do you suppose Steve Minster got his
      millions? Did you think he minted them? Didn&rsquo;t every dollar pass through
      some other fellow&rsquo;s pocket before it reached his? The only difference was
      that when it got into his pocket it stuck there. Everybody is looking out
      to get rich; and when a man succeeds, it only means that somebody else has
      got poor. That&rsquo;s plain common-sense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation practically ended here. Mr. Tenney devoted some quarter
      of an hour to going severally over all the papers in the Minster box, but
      glancing through only those few which referred to the Thessaly
      Manufacturing Company. The proceeding seemed to Horace to be irregular,
      but he could not well refuse, and Tenney was not interrupted. When he had
      finished his task he shook hands with Horace with a novel cordiality, and
      it was not difficult to guess that the result of his search had pleased
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure those are all the papers Clarke left to be turned over?&rdquo; he
      asked. Upon being assured in the affirmative his eyes emitted a glance
      which was like a flash of light, and his lip lifted in a smile of obvious
      elation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fortune for both of us,&rdquo; he said, jubilantly, as he unlocked
      the door, and shook hands again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Horace poured out another drink and sat down to
      meditate.

      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;NO MESSAGE FOR MAMMA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>our days of
      anxious meditation did not help Horace Boyce to clear his mind, and on the
      fifth he determined upon a somewhat desperate step, in the hope that its
      issue would assist decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dilemma was simple enough in character. Two ways of acquiring a
      fortune lay before him. One was to marry Kate Minster; the other was to
      join the plot against her property and that of her family, which the
      subtile Tenney was darkly shaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The misery of the situation was that he must decide at once which of the
      ways he would choose. In his elation at being selected as the legal
      adviser and agent of these millionnaire women, no such contingency as this
      had been foreseen. He had assumed that abundant time would be at his
      disposal, and he had said to himself that with time all things may be
      accomplished with all women.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this precious element of time had been harshly cut out of his plans,
      here at the very start. The few days reluctantly granted him had gone by,
      one by one, with cruel swiftness, and to-morrow would be Monday&mdash;and
      still his mind was not made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he could be assured that Miss Minster would marry him, or at least
      admit him to the vantage-ground of <i>quasi-recognition</i> as a suitor,
      the difficulty would be solved at once. He would turn around and defend
      her and her people against the machinations of Tenney. Just what the
      machinations were he could not for the life of him puzzle out, but he felt
      sure that, whatever their nature, he could defeat them, if only he were
      given the right to do battle in the name of the family, as a prospective
      member of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it might be that he had no present chance with Miss
      Minster as an eligible husband. What would happen if he relied on a
      prospect which turned out not to exist? His own opportunity to share in
      the profits of Tenney&rsquo;s plan would be abruptly extinguished, and his
      father would be thrown upon the world as a discredited bankrupt. About
      that there was no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the distracted young man thought he caught glimpses of a safe
      middle course. In these sanguine moments it seemed feasible to give in his
      adhesion to Tenney&rsquo;s scheme, and go along with him for a certain time, say
      until the intentions of the conspirators were revealed. Then he might
      suddenly revolt, throw himself into a virtuous attitude, and win credit
      and gratitude at the hands of the family by protecting them from their
      enemies. Then the game would be in his own hands, and no mistake!
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other times when this course did not present so many
      attractions to his mind&mdash;when it was borne in upon him that Tenney
      would be a dangerous kind of man to betray. He had seen merciless and
      terrible depths in the gray eyes of the hardware merchant&mdash;depths
      which somehow suggested bones stripped clean of their flesh, sucked bare
      of their marrow, at the bottom of a gloomy sea. In these seasons of doubt,
      which came mostly in the early morning when he first awoke, the mere
      thought of Tenney&rsquo;s hatred made him shudder. It was as if Hugo&rsquo;s
      devil-fish had crawled into his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Sunday afternoon came and found the young man still perplexed and
      harassed. To do him justice, he had once or twice dwelt momentarily on the
      plan of simply defying Tenney and doing his duty by the Minsters, and
      taking his chances. But these impulses were as quickly put down. The case
      was too complicated for mere honesty. The days of martyrdom were long
      since past. One needed to be smarter than one&rsquo;s neighbors in these later
      times. To eat others was the rule now, if one would save himself from
      being devoured. It was at least clear to his mind that he must be smart,
      and play his hand so as to get the odd trick even if honors were held
      against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace decided finally that the wisest thing he could do would be to call
      upon the Minsters before nightfall, and trust to luck for some opportunity
      of discovering Miss Kate&rsquo;s state of mind toward him. He was troubled more
      or less by fears that Sunday might not be regarded in Thessaly as a proper
      day for calls, as he dressed himself for the adventure. But when he got
      upon the street, the fresh air and exhilaration oc exercise helped to
      reassure him. Before he reached the Minster gate he had even grown to feel
      that the ladies had probably had a dull day of it, and would welcome his
      advent as a diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown into the stately parlor to the left of the wide hall&mdash;a
      room he had not seen before&mdash;and left to sit there in solitude for
      some minutes. This term of waiting he employed in looking over the
      portraits on the wall and the photographs on the mantels and tables. Aside
      from several pictures of the dissipated Minster boy who had died, he could
      see no faces of young men anywhere, and he felt this to be a good sign as
      he tiptoed his way back to his seat by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune smiled at least upon the opening of his enterprise. It was Miss
      Kate who came at last to receive him, and she came alone. The young man&rsquo;s
      cultured sense of beauty and breeding was caressed and captivated as it
      had never been before&mdash;at least in America, he made mental
      reservation&mdash;as she came across the room toward him, and held out her
      hand. He felt himself unexpectedly at ease, as he returned her greeting
      and looked with smiling warmth into her splendid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His talk was facile and pleasant. He touched lightly upon his doubts as to
      making calls on Sunday, and how they were overborne by the unspeakable
      tedium of his own rooms. Then he spoke of the way the more unconventional
      circles of London utilize the day, and of the contrasting features of the
      Continental Sunday. Miss Kate seemed interested, and besides explaining
      that her mother was writing letters and that her sister was not very well,
      bore a courteous and affable part in the exchange of small-talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time nothing was said which enabled Horace to feel that the
      purpose of his visit had been or was likely to be served. Then, all at
      once, through a most unlikely channel, the needed personal element was
      introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma tells me,&rdquo; she said, when a moment&rsquo;s pause had sufficed to dismiss
      some other subject, &ldquo;that she has turned over to you such of her business
      as poor old Mr. Clarke used to take care of, and that your partner, Mr.
      Tracy, has nothing to do with that particular branch of your work. Isn&rsquo;t
      that unusual? I thought partners always shared everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo; replied Horace. &ldquo;Mr. Tracy, for example, has railroad
      business which he keeps to himself. He is the attorney for this section of
      the road, and of course that is a personal appointment. He couldn&rsquo;t share
      it with me, any more than the man in the story could make his wife and
      children corporals because he had been made one himself. Besides, Mr.
      Tracy was expressly mentioned by your mother as not to be included in the
      transfer of business. It was her notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; said that young woman, with a slight instantaneous lifting
      of the black brows which Horace did not catch. &ldquo;Why? Isn&rsquo;t he nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes; he&rsquo;s an extremely good fellow, in his way,&rdquo; the partner
      admitted, looking down at his glossy boots in well-simulated hesitation.
      &ldquo;That little word &lsquo;nice&rsquo; means so many things upon feminine lips, you
      know,&rdquo; he added with a smile. &ldquo;Perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t answer your definition
      of it all around. He&rsquo;s very honest, and he is a prodigious worker, but&mdash;well,
      to be frank, he&rsquo;s farm bred, and I daresay your mother suspected the
      existence of&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;an uncouth side? Really, I
      don&rsquo;t think that there was anything more than that in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you furnish the polish, and he the honesty and industry? Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were distinctly unpleasant, and Horace looked up swiftly to the
      speaker&rsquo;s face, feeling that his own was flushed. But Miss Kate was
      smiling at him, with a quizzical light dancing in her eyes, and this
      reassured him on the instant. Evidently she felt herself on easy terms
      with him, and this was merely a bit of playful chaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t put it quite in that way,&rdquo; he said, with an answering laugh. &ldquo;It
      would be rather egotistical, on both sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowadays everybody resents that imputation as if it were a cardinal sin.
      There was a time when self-esteem was taken for granted. I suppose it went
      out with chain-armor and farthingales.&rdquo; She spoke in a musing tone, and
      added after a tiny pause, &ldquo;That must have been a happy time, at least for
      those who wore the armor and the brocades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace leaped with avidity at the opening. &ldquo;Those were the days of
      romance,&rdquo; he said, with an effort at the cooing effect in his voice.
      &ldquo;Perhaps they were not so altogether lovely as our fancy paints them; but,
      all the same, it is very sweet to have the fancy. Whether it be
      historically true or not, those who possess it are rich in their own
      mind&rsquo;s right. They can always escape from the grimy and commercial
      conditions of this present work-a-day life. All one&rsquo;s finer senses can
      feed, for example, on a glowing account of an old-time tournament&mdash;with
      the sun shining on the armor and burnished shields, and the waving plumes
      and iron-clad horses and the heralds in tabards, and the rows of fair
      ladies clustered about the throne&mdash;as it is impossible to do on the
      report of a meeting of a board of directors, even when they declare you an
      exceptionally large dividend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man kept a close watch upon this flow of words as it proceeded,
      and felt satisfied with it. The young woman seemed to like it too, for she
      had sunk back into her chair with an added air of ease, and looked at him
      now with what he took to be a more sympathetic glance, as she made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are positively romantic, Mr. Boyce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? My dear Miss Minster, I am the most sentimental person alive,&rdquo; Horace
      protested gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find that it interferes with your profession?&rdquo; she asked, with
      that sparkle of banter in her dark eyes which he began to find so
      delicious. &ldquo;I thought lawyers had to eschew sentiment. Or perhaps you
      supply <i>that</i>, too, in this famous partnership of yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace laughed with pleasure. &ldquo;Would you like me the less if I admitted
      it?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; she replied on the instant, still with the smile which kept
      him from shaping a harsh interpretation of her words. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t Thessaly
      a rather incongruous place for sentimental people? We have no
      tourney-field&mdash;only rolling-mills and button-factories and furnaces;
      and there isn&rsquo;t a knight, much less a herald in a tabard, left in the
      whole village. Their places have been taken by moulders and puddlers. So
      what will the minstrel do then, poor thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him come here sometimes,&rdquo; said the young man, in the gravely ardent
      tone which this sort of situation demanded. &ldquo;Let him come here, and forget
      that this is the nineteenth century; forget time and Thessaly altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but mamma wouldn&rsquo;t like that at all; I mean about your forgetting so
      much. She expects you particularly to remember both time <i>and</i>
      Thessaly. No, decidedly; that would never do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile and the glance were intoxicating. The young man made his plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>may</i> I come?&rdquo; His voice had become low and vibrant, and it went
      on eagerly: &ldquo;May I come if I promise to remember everything; if I swear to
      remember nothing else save what you&mdash;and your mother&mdash;would have
      me charge my memory with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are always glad to see our friends on Tuesdays, from two to five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not in the plural,&rdquo; he urged, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are,&rdquo; she made answer, still watching him with a smile, from where she
      half-reclined in the easy-chair. Her face was in the shadow of the heavier
      under-curtains; the mellow light gave it a uniform tint of ivory washed
      with rose, and enriched the wonder of her eyes, and softened into melting
      witchery the lines of lips and brows and of the raven diadem of curls upon
      her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in that the graces and charms of a thousand perfect women are
      centred here in one,&rdquo; murmured Horace. It was in his heart as well as his
      head to say more, but now she rose abruptly at this, with a laugh which
      for the instant disconcerted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I foresee <i>such</i> a future for this firm of yours,&rdquo; she cried,
      with high merriment alike in voice and face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they both stood in the full light of the window, the young man somehow
      seemed to miss that yielding softness in her face which had lulled his
      sense and fired his senses in the misleading shadows of the curtain. It
      was still a very beautiful face, but there was a great deal of
      self-possession in it. Perhaps it would be as well just now to go no
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try to live up to your good opinion, and your kindly forecast,&rdquo;
       he said, as he momentarily touched the hand she offered him. &ldquo;You cannot
      possibly imagine how glad I am to have braved the conventionalities in
      calling, and to have found you at home. It has transformed the rural
      Sunday from a burden into a beatitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty, Mr. Boyce! Is there any message for mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why did you say that?&rdquo; He ventured upon a tone of mock vexation. &ldquo;I
      wanted so much to go away with the fancy that this was an enchanted
      palace, and that you were shut up alone in it, waiting for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuesdays, from two till five,&rdquo; she broke in, with a bow, in the same
      spirit of amiable raillery, and so he said good-by and made his way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he succeeded? Was there a promise of success? Horace took a long walk
      before he finally turned his steps homeward, and pondered these problems
      excitedly in his mind. On the whole, he concluded that he could win her.
      That she was for herself better worth the winning than even for her
      million, he said to himself over and over again with rapture.

    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kate went up-stairs and into the sitting-room common to the sisters,
      in which Ethel lay on the sofa in front of the fire-place. She knelt
      beside this sofa, and held her hands over the subdued flame of the maple
      sticks on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so cold down in the parlor,&rdquo; she remarked, by way of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stayed an unconscionable while,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;What could he have
      talked about? I had almost a mind to waive my headache and come down to
      find out. It was a full hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have thanked you if you had, my little girl,&rdquo; replied Kate
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he dislike little girls of nineteen so much? How unique!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he came to make love to the big girl; that is why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sat bolt upright. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; she said, with her hazel eyes
      wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> did,&rdquo; was the sententious reply. Kate was busy warming the
      backs of her hands now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me! And I lay here all the while, and never had so much as a
      premonition. Oh, what was it like? Did he get on his knees? Was it very,
      <i>very</i> funny? Make haste and tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it <i>was</i> funny, after a fashion. At least, we both laughed a
      good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How touching! Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all. I laughed at him, and he laughed&mdash;I suppose it must
      have been at me&mdash;and he paid me some quite thrilling compliments, and
      I replied, &lsquo;Tuesdays, from two to five,&rsquo; like an educated jackdaw&mdash;and&mdash;that
      was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a romance! How could you think of such a clever answer, right on the
      spur of the moment, too? But I always said you were the bright one of the
      family, Kate. Perhaps one&rsquo;s mind works better in the cold, anyway. But I
      think he <i>might</i> have knelt down. You should have put him close to
      the register. I daresay the cold stiffened his joints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ever be serious, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel took her sister&rsquo;s head in her hands and turned it gently, so that
      she might look into the other&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that <i>you</i> are serious, Kate?&rdquo; she asked, in tender
      wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder girl laughed, and lifted herself to sit on the sofa beside
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; of course it isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; she said, and put her arm about the
      invalid&rsquo;s slender waist. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s great fun to talk to. I chaffed him to
      my heart&rsquo;s content, and he saw what I meant, every time, and didn&rsquo;t mind
      in the least, and gave me as good as I sent. It&rsquo;s such a relief to find
      somebody you can say saucy things to, and be quite sure they understand
      them. I began by disliking him&mdash;and he <i>is</i> as conceited as a
      popinjay&mdash;but then he comprehended everything so perfectly, and
      talked so well, that positively I found myself enjoying it. And he knew
      his own mind, too, and was resolved to say nice things to me, and said
      them, whether I liked or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>did</i> you &lsquo;like,&rsquo; Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, I think not,&rdquo; the girl replied, musingly. &ldquo;But, all the same, there
      was a kind of satisfaction in hearing them, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger girl drew her sister&rsquo;s head down to her shoulder, and caressed
      it with her thin, white fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to let your mind drift into anything foolish, Kate?&rdquo;
       she said, with a quaver of anxiety in her tone. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the man.
      You don&rsquo;t even like him. You told me so, even from what you saw of him on
      the train coming from New York. You said he patronized everybody and
      everything, and didn&rsquo;t have a good word to say for any one. Don&rsquo;t you know
      you did? And those first impressions are always nearest the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This recalled something to Kate&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;You are right, puss,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> a failing of his. He spoke to-day almost contemptuously of
      his partner&mdash;that Mr. Tracy whom I met in the milliner&rsquo;s shop; and
      that annoyed me at the time, for I liked Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s looks and talk very
      much indeed, <i>I</i> shouldn&rsquo;t call him uncouth, at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was that Boyce man&rsquo;s word, was it?&rdquo; commented Ethel. &ldquo;Well, then, I
      think that beside his partner, he is a pretentious, disagreeable monkey&mdash;there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate smiled at her sister&rsquo;s vehemence. &ldquo;At least it is an unprejudiced
      judgment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen them both,&rdquo; replied Ethel, conclusively.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;THE MAN FROM NEW YORK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the great field
      of armed politics in Europe, every now and again there arises a situation
      which everybody agrees must inevitably result in war. Yet just when the
      newspapers have reached their highest state of excitement, and
      &ldquo;sensational incidents&rdquo; and &ldquo;significant occurrences&rdquo; are crowding one
      another in the hurly-burly of alarmist despatches with utmost
      impressiveness, somehow the cloud passes away, and the sun comes out again&mdash;and
      nothing has happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun did not precisely shine for Horace Boyce in the weeks which now
      ensued, but at least the crisis that had threatened to engulf him was
      curiously delayed. Mr. Tenney did not even ask him, on that dreaded
      Monday, what decision he had arrived at. A number of other Mondays went
      by, and still no demand was made upon him to announce his choice. On the
      few occasions when he met his father&rsquo;s partner, it was the pleasure of
      that gentleman to talk on other subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man began to regain his equanimity. The February term of Oyer
      and Terminer had come and gone, and Horace was reasonably satisfied with
      the forensic display he had made. It would have been much better, he knew,
      if he had not been worried about the other thing; but, as it was, he had
      won two of the four cases in which he appeared, had got on well with the
      judge, who invited him to dinner at the Dearborn House, and had been
      congratulated on his speeches by quite a number of lawyers. His foothold
      in Thessaly was established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters about the office had not gone altogether to his liking, it was
      true. For some reason, Reuben seemed all at once to have become more
      distant and formal with him. Horace could not dream that this arose from
      the discoveries his partner had made at the milliner&rsquo;s shop, and so put
      the changed demeanor down vaguely to Reuben&rsquo;s jealousy of his success in
      court. He was sorry that this was so, because he liked Reuben personally,
      and the silly fellow ought to be glad that he had such a showy and clever
      partner, instead of sulking. Horace began to harbor the notion that a year
      of this partnership would probably be enough for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Citizens&rsquo; Club had held two meetings, and Horace felt that the manner
      in which he had presided and directed the course of action at these
      gatherings had increased his hold upon the town. Nearly fifty men had now
      joined the club, and next month they were to discuss the question of a
      permanent habitation. They all seemed to like him as president, and
      nebulous thoughts about being the first mayor of Thessaly, when the
      village should get its charter, now occasionally floated across the young
      man&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had called at the Minster house on each Tuesday since that conversation
      with Miss Kate, and now felt himself to be on terms almost intimate with
      the whole household. He could not say, even to himself, that his suit had
      progressed much; but Miss Kate seemed to like him, and her mother, whom he
      also had seen at other times on matters of business, was very friendly
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus affairs stood with the rising young lawyer at the beginning of March,
      when he one day received a note sent across by hand from Mr. Tenney,
      asking him to come over at once to the Dearborn House, and meet him in a
      certain room designated by number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace was conscious of some passing surprise that Tenney should make
      appointments in private rooms of the local hotel, but as he crossed the
      street to the old tavern and climbed the stairs to the apartment named, it
      did not occur to him that the summons might signify that the crisis which
      had darkened the first weeks of February was come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Tenney awaiting him at the door, and after he had perfunctorily
      shaken hands with him, discovered that there was another man inside,
      seated at the table in the centre of the parlor, under the chandelier.
      This man was past middle-age, and both his hair and the thick, short beard
      which covered his chin and throat were nearly white. Horace noted first
      that his long upper lip was shaven, and this grated upon him afresh as one
      of the least lovely of provincial American customs. Then he observed that
      this man had eyes like Tenney&rsquo;s in expression, though they were blue
      instead of gray; and as this resemblance came to him, Tenney spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Wendover, this is the young man we&rsquo;ve been talking about&mdash;Mr.
      Horace Boyce, son of my partner, the General, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious New Yorker had at last appeared on the scene, then. He did
      not look very mysterious, or very metropolitan either, as he rose slowly
      and reached his hand across the table for Horace to shake. It was a fat
      and inert hand, and the Judge himself, now that he stood up, was seen to
      be also fat and dumpy in figure, with a bald head, noticeably high at the
      back of the skull, and a loose, badly fitted suit of clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said to Horace, much as if that young man had been a
      stenographer called in to report a conversation. Horace took the chair
      indicated, not over pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got much time,&rdquo; the Judge continued, speaking apparently to the
      papers in front of him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal to do, and I&rsquo;ve got to catch
      that 5.22 train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New Yorkers generally do have to catch trains,&rdquo; remarked Horace. &ldquo;So far
      as I could see, the few times I&rsquo;ve been there of late years, that is
      always the chief thing on their minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Wendover looked at the young man for the space of a second, and then
      turned to Tenney and said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he knows how the Thessaly Mfg. Company stands? How it&rsquo;s
      stocked?&rdquo; He pronounced the three letters with a slurring swiftness, as if
      to indicate that there was not time enough for the full word
      &ldquo;manufacturing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace himself answered the question: &ldquo;Yes, I know. You represent two
      hundred and twenty-five to my clients&rsquo; one hundred and seventy-five.&rdquo; The
      young man held himself erect and alert in his chair, and spoke curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. The capital is four hundred thousand dollars&mdash;all paid up.
      Well, we need that much more to go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How &lsquo;go on&rsquo;? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a new nail machine just out which makes our plant worthless. To
      buy that, and make the changes, will cost a round four hundred thousand
      dollars. Get hold of that machine, and we control the whole United States
      market; fail to get it, we go under. That&rsquo;s the long and short of it.
      That&rsquo;s why we sent for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; said Horace, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t happen to have four hundred
      thousand dollars with me just at the moment. If you&rsquo;d let me known
      earlier, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge looked at him again, with the impersonal point-blank stare of a
      very rich and pre-occupied old man. Evidently this young fellow thought
      himself a joker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool,&rdquo; he said, testily. &ldquo;Business is business, time is money. We
      can&rsquo;t increase our capital by law, but we can borrow. You haven&rsquo;t got any
      money, but the Minster women have. It&rsquo;s to their interest to stand by us.
      They&rsquo;ve got almost as much in the concern as we have. I&rsquo;ve seen the widow
      and explained the situation to her. She understands it. But she won&rsquo;t back
      our paper, because her husband on his death-bed made her promise never to
      do that for anybody. Curious prejudice these countrymen have about
      indorsing notes. Business would stagnate in a day without indorsing.
      However, I had another plan. Let her issue four hundred thousand dollars
      in bonds on the iron-works. That&rsquo;s about a third what they are worth.
      She&rsquo;ll consent to that if you talk to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> where I come in, is it?&rdquo; said Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else did you suppose?&rdquo; asked the Judge, puffing for breath, as he
      eyed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer was forthcoming, and the New Yorker went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The interest on those bonds will cost her twenty-four thousand dollars
      per year for a year or two, but it will make her shares in the Mfg.
      Company a real property instead of a paper asset. Besides, I&rsquo;ve shown her
      a way to-day, by going into the big pig-iron trust that is being formed,
      of making twice that amount in half the time. Now, she&rsquo;s going to talk
      with you about both these things. Your play is to advise her to do what
      I&rsquo;ve suggested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; Horace put the question bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; answered the Judge, who seemed to like this direct way of
      dealing. &ldquo;You can make a pot of money by it. And that isn&rsquo;t all. Tenney
      and I are not fishing with pin-hooks and thread. We&rsquo;ve got nets, young
      man. You tie up to us, and we&rsquo;ll take care of you. When you see a big
      thing like this travelling your way, hitch on to it. That&rsquo;s the way
      fortunes are made. And you&rsquo;ve got a chance that don&rsquo;t come to one young
      fellow in ten thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he had,&rdquo; put in Mr. Tenney, who had been a silent but
      attentive auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will happen if I decline?&rdquo; asked Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will lose her one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars and a
      good deal more, and you will lose your business with her and with
      everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your father will lose the precious little he&rsquo;s got left,&rdquo; put in Mr.
      Tenney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace tried to smile. &ldquo;Upon my word, you are frank,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to be anything else,&rdquo; replied the Judge. &ldquo;And why
      shouldn&rsquo;t we be? We simply state facts to you. A great commercial
      transaction, involving profits to everybody, is outlined before you. It
      happens that by my recommendation you are in a place where you can
      embarrass its success, for a minute or two, if you have a mind to. But why
      in God&rsquo;s name you should have a mind to, or why you take up time by
      pretending to be offish about it, is more than I can make out. Damn it,
      sir, you&rsquo;re not a woman, who wants to be asked a dozen times! You&rsquo;re a
      man, lucky enough to be associated with other men who have their heads
      screwed on the right way, and so don&rsquo;t waste any more time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that reminds me,&rdquo; said Horace, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thanked you for
      recommending me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the Judge, bluntly. &ldquo;It was Tenney&rsquo;s doing. I
      didn&rsquo;t know you from a side of sole-leather. But <i>he</i> thought you
      were the right man for the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not disappointed,&rdquo; Horace remarked, with a questioning
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A minute will tell me whether I am or not,&rdquo; the New York man exclaimed,
      letting his fat hand fall upon the table. &ldquo;Come, what is your answer? Are
      you with us, or against us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events not against you, I should hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the man! Hasn&rsquo;t he got a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; in him?&mdash;Tenney, you&rsquo;re
      to blame for this,&rdquo; snapped Wendover, pulling his watch from the fob in
      his tightened waistband, and scowling at the dial. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to run, as
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose again from his chair, and bent a sharp gaze upon Horace&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, young man,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;what is your answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can see my way to obliging you,&rdquo; said Horace, hesitatingly.
      &ldquo;But, of course, I want to know just how I am to stand in the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Tenney will see to,&rdquo; said the Judge, swiftly. He gathered up the
      papers on the table, thrust them into a portfolio with a lock on it, which
      he gave to Tenney, snatched his hat, and was gone, without a word of adieu
      to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great man of business, that!&rdquo; remarked the hardware merchant, after a
      moment of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace nodded assent, but his mind had not followed the waddling figure of
      the financier. It was dwelling perplexedly upon the outcome of this
      adventure upon which he seemed to be fully embarked, and trying to
      establish a conviction that it would be easy to withdraw from it at will,
      later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can make millions where other men only see thousands, and they beyond
      their reach,&rdquo; pursued Tenney, in an abstracted voice. &ldquo;When he&rsquo;s your
      friend, there isn&rsquo;t anything you can&rsquo;t do; and he&rsquo;s as straight as a
      string, too, so long as he likes a man. But he&rsquo;s a terror to have ag&rsquo;in
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace sat closeted with Tenney for a long time, learning the details of
      the two plans which had been presented to Mrs. Minster, and which he was
      expected to support. The sharpest scrutiny could detect nothing dishonest
      in them. Both involved mere questions of expediency&mdash;to loan money in
      support of one&rsquo;s stock, and to enter a trust which was to raise the price
      of one&rsquo;s wares&mdash;and it was not difficult for Horace to argue himself
      into the belief that both promised to be beneficial to his client.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the interview Horace said plainly to his companion that he
      saw no reason why he should not advise Mrs. Minster to adopt both of the
      Judge&rsquo;s recommendations. &ldquo;They seem perfectly straightforward,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect anything else, knowing me all this while?&rdquo; asked Tenney,
      reproachfully.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OME ten days
      later, Reuben Tracy was vastly surprised one afternoon to receive a note
      from Miss Minster. The office-boy said that the messenger was waiting for
      an answer, and had been warned to hand the missive to no one except him.
      The note ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir: I hope very much that you can find time to call here at our
      house during the afternoon. Pray ask for me, and do not mention<i> to any
      one</i> that you are coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>It will not seem to you, I am sure, that I have taken a liberty either
      in my request or my injunction, after you have heard the explanation.
      Sincerely yours,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate Minster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben sent back a written line to say that he would come within an hour,
      and then tried to devote himself to the labor of finishing promptly the
      task he had in hand. It was a very simple piece of conveyancing&mdash;work
      he generally performed with facility&mdash;but to-day he found himself
      spoiling sheet after sheet of &ldquo;legal cap,&rdquo; by stupid omissions and
      unconscious inversions of the quaint legal phraseology. His thoughts would
      not be enticed away from the subject of the note&mdash;the perfume of
      which was apparent upon the musty air of the office, even as it lay in its
      envelope before him. There was nothing remarkable in the fact that Miss
      Minster wanted to see him&mdash;of course, it was with reference to
      Jessica&rsquo;s plan for the factory-girls&mdash;but the admonition to secrecy
      puzzled him a good deal. The word &ldquo;explanation,&rdquo; too, had a portentous
      look. What could it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster had been closeted in the library with her lawyer, Mr. Horace
      Boyce, for fully two hours that forenoon, and afterward, in the hearing of
      her daughters, had invited him to stay for luncheon. He had pleaded
      pressure of business as an excuse for not accepting the invitation, and
      had taken a hurried departure forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls exchanged glances at all this. Mr. Boyce had never been
      asked before to the family table, and there was something pre-occupied,
      almost brusque, in his manner of declining the exceptional honor and
      hurrying off as he did. They noted, too, that their mother seemed
      unwontedly excited about something, and experience told them that her calm
      Knickerbocker nature was not to be stirred by trivial matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, while they lingered over the jellied dainties of the light noonday
      meal, Kate made bold to put the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is worrying you, mamma,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is it anything that we know
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, no!&rdquo; Mrs. Minster replied. &ldquo;It is nothing at all. Of course, I&rsquo;m
      not worried. What an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you acted as if there was something on your mind,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you would act so, too, if&mdash;&rdquo; There Mrs. Minster stopped short,
      and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what, mamma?&rdquo; put in Ethel. &ldquo;<i>We knew</i> there was something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sticks to it that issuing bonds is not mortgaging, and, of course, he
      ought to know; but I remember that when they bonded our town for the
      Harlem road, father said it <i>was</i> a mortgage,&rdquo; answered the mother,
      not over luminously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What bonds? What mortgage?&rdquo; Kate spoke with emphasis. &ldquo;We have a right to
      know, surely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, you can see for yourself,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Minster, &ldquo;that the
      interest must be more than made up by the extra price iron will bring when
      the trust puts up prices. That is what trusts are for&mdash;to put up
      prices. You can read that in the papers every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, what have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate had pushed back her plate, and leaned over the table now, flashing
      sharp inquiry into her mother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I insist upon knowing, and so does
      Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s wise and resolute countenance never more thoroughly belied
      the condition of her mind than at this moment. She felt that she did not
      rightly know just what she had done, and vague fears as to consequences
      rose to possess her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had spoken to my mother in that way when I was your age, I should
      have been sent from the room&mdash;big girl though I was. I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t
      guess where you take your temper from. The Mauverensens were always&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not satisfactory, and Kate broke into the discourse about her
      maternal ancestors peremptorily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about all that. But some business step has been taken, and
      it must concern Ethel and me, and I wish you would tell us plainly what it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Thessaly Company found it necessary to buy the right of a new nail
      machine, and they had to have money to do it with, and so some bonds are
      to be issued to provide it. It is quite the customary thing, I assure you,
      in business affairs. Only, what I maintained was that it <i>was</i> the
      same as a mortgage, but Judge Wendover and Mr. Boyce insisted it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is, perhaps, an interesting commentary upon the commercial education of
      these two wealthy young ladies, that they themselves were unable to form
      an opinion upon this debated point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bonds are something like stocks,&rdquo; Ethel explained. &ldquo;They are always
      mentioned together. But mortgages must be different, for they are kept in
      the county clerk&rsquo;s office. I know that, because Ella Dupont&rsquo;s father used
      to get paid fifty cents apiece for searching after them there. She told me
      so. They must have been very careless to lose them so often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster in some way regarded this as a defence of her action, and
      took heart. &ldquo;Well, then, I also signed an agreement which puts us into the
      great combination they&rsquo;re getting up&mdash;all the iron manufacturers of
      Pennsylvania and Ohio and New York&mdash;called the Amalgamated Pig-Iron
      Trust. I was very strongly advised to do that; and it stands to reason
      that prices will go up, because trusts limit production. Surely, that is
      plain enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have consulted us,&rdquo; said Kate, not the less firmly because
      her advice, she knew, would have been of no earthly value. &ldquo;You have a
      power-of-attorney to sign for us, but it was really for routine matters,
      so that the property might act as a whole. In a great matter like this, I
      think we should have known about it first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know anything about it now, even when I <i>have</i> told
      you!&rdquo; Mrs. Minster pointed out, not without justification for her
      triumphant tone. &ldquo;It is perfectly useless for us women to try and
      understand these things. Our only safety is in being advised by men who do
      know, and in whom we have perfect confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Boyce is a very young man, and you scarcely know him,&rdquo; objected
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was strongly recommended to me by Judge Wendover,&rdquo; replied the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray who recommended Judge Wendover?&rdquo; asked Kate, with latent
      sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he was bom in the same town with me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Minster, as if no
      answer could be more sufficient. &ldquo;My grandfather Douw Mauverensen&rsquo;s sister
      married a Wendover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about the bonds,&rdquo; pursued the eldest daughter. &ldquo;What amount of money
      do they represent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls opened their eyes at this, and their mother hastened to add:
      &ldquo;But it really isn&rsquo;t very important, when you come to look at it. It is
      only what Judge Wendover calls making one hand wash the other. The money
      raised on the bonds will put the Thessaly Company on its feet, and so then
      that will pay dividends, and so we will get back the interest, and more
      too. The bonds we can buy back whenever we choose. <i>I</i> managed that,
      because when Judge Wendover said the bonds would be perfectly good, I
      said, &lsquo;If they are so good, why don&rsquo;t you take them yourself?&rsquo; And he
      seemed struck with that and said he would. They didn&rsquo;t get much the best
      of me there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow this did not seem very clear to Kate. &ldquo;If he had the money to take
      the bonds, what was the need of any bonds at all?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
      he buy this machinery himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been regular; there was some legal obstacle in the way,&rdquo;
       the mother replied. &ldquo;He explained it to me, but I didn&rsquo;t quite catch it.
      At all events, there <i>had</i> to be bonds. Even <i>he</i> couldn&rsquo;t see
      any way ont of <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope it is all right,&rdquo; said Kate, and the conversation lapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But upon reflection, in her own room, the matter seemed less and less all
      right, and finally, after a long and not very helpful consultation with
      her sister, Kate suddenly thought of Reuben Tracy. A second later she had
      fully decided to ask his advice, and swift upon this rose the resolve to
      summon him immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that the perfumed note came to be sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben took the seat in the drawing-room of the Minsters indicated by the
      servant who had admitted him, and it did not occur to this member of the
      firm of Tracy &amp; Boyce to walk about and look at the pictures, much
      less to wonder how many of them were of young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in this dull light he could recognize, on the opposite wall, a
      boyhood portrait of the Stephen Minster, Junior, whose early death had
      dashed so many hopes, and pointed so many morals to the profit of godly
      villagers. He thought about this worthless, brief career, as his eyes
      rested on the bright, boyish face of the portrait, with the clear dark
      eyes and the fresh-tinted cheeks, and his serious mind filled itself with
      protests against the conditions which had made of this heir to millions a
      rake and a fool. There was no visible reason why Stephen Minster&rsquo;s son
      should not have been clever and strong, a fit master of the great part
      created for him by his father. There must be some blight, some mysterious
      curse upon hereditary riches here in America, thought Reuben, for all at
      once he found himself persuaded that this was the rule with most rich
      men&rsquo;s sons. Therein lay a terrible menace to the Republic, he said to
      himself. Vague musings upon the possibility of remedying this were
      beginning to float in his brain&mdash;the man could never contemplate
      injustices, great or small, without longing to set them right&mdash;when
      the door opened and the tall young elder daughter of the Minsters entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben rose and felt himself making some such obeisance before her in
      spirit as one lays at the feet of a queen. What he did in reality or what
      he said, left no record on his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been seated again for some minutes, and had listened with the
      professional side of his mind to most of what story she had to tell,
      before he regained control of his perceptions and began to realize that
      the most beautiful woman he had ever seen was confiding to him her
      anxieties, as a friend even more than as a lawyer. The situation was so
      wonderful that it needed all the control he had over his faculties to
      grasp and hold it. Always afterward he thought of the moment in which his
      confusion of mind vanished, and he, sitting on the sofa facing her chair,
      was able to lean back a little and talk as if he had known her a long
      time, as the turning-point in his whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      What it was in her power to tell him about the transaction which had
      frightened her did not convey a very clear idea to his mind. A mortgage of
      four hundred thousand dollars had been placed upon the Minsters&rsquo; property
      to meet the alleged necessities of a company in which they were large
      owners, and their own furnaces had been put under the control of a big
      trust formed by other manufacturers, presumably for the benefit of all its
      members. This was what he made out of her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On their face,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these things seem regular enough. The doubtful
      point, of course, would be whether, in both transactions, your interests
      and those of your family were perfectly safe-guarded. This is something I
      can form no opinion about. But Mr. Boyce must have looked out for that and
      seen that you got &lsquo;value received.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Boyce! That is just the question,&rdquo; Kate answered, swiftly. &ldquo;<i>Has</i>
      he looked out for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curiously enough he has never spoken with me, even indirectly, about
      having taken charge of your mother&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; replied Reuben, slowly.
      &ldquo;But he is a competent man, with a considerable talent for detail, and a
      good knowledge of business, as well as of legal forms. I should say you
      might be perfectly easy about his capacity to guard your interests; oh,
      yes, entirely easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t his capacity that I was thinking about,&rdquo; said the young woman,
      hesitatingly. &ldquo;I wanted to ask you about him himself&mdash;about the <i>man</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben smiled in an involuntary effort to conceal his uneasiness. &ldquo;They
      say that no man is a hero to his valet, you know,&rdquo; he made answer. &ldquo;In the
      same way business men ought not to be cross-examined on the opinions which
      the community at large may have concerning their partners. Boyce and I
      occupy, in a remote kind of way, the relations of husband and wife. We
      maintain a public attitude toward each other of great respect and
      admiration, and are bound to do so by the same rules which govern the
      heads of a family. And we mustn&rsquo;t talk about each other. You never would
      go to one of a married couple for an opinion about the other. If the
      opinion were all praise, you would set it down to prejudice; if it were
      censure, the fact of its source would shock you. Oh, no, partners mustn&rsquo;t
      discuss each other. That would be letting all the bars down with a
      vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had said all this with an effort at lightness, and ended, as he had
      begun, with a smile. Kate, looking intently into his face, did not smile
      in response. He thought her expression was one of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I was wrong to ask you,&rdquo; she answered, after a little pause, and
      in a colder tone. &ldquo;You men do stand by each other so splendidly. It is the
      secret of your strength. It is why your sex possesses the earth, and the
      fulness thereof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was easier for Reuben to smile naturally this time. &ldquo;But I illustrated
      my position by an example of a still finer reticence,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the
      finest one can imagine&mdash;that of husband and wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not married, I believe, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; was her comment, and its edge
      was apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, and stopped short. No other words came to his tongue, and
      his thoughts seemed to have gone away into somebody else&rsquo;s mind, leaving
      only a formless blank, over which hung, like a canopy of cloud, a
      depressing uneasiness lest his visit should not, after all, turn out a
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I have needlessly worried myself,&rdquo; she was saying when he
      came back into mental life again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether that, either,&rdquo; he replied, moving in his seat, and sitting
      upright like a man who has shaken himself out of a disposition to doze.
      &ldquo;So far as you have described them, the transactions may easily be all
      right. Everything depends upon details which you cannot give. The sum
      seems a large one to raise for the purchase of machinery, and it might be
      well to inquire into the exact nature and validity of the purchase. As for
      the terms upon which you lend the money to the company, of course Mr.
      Boyce has secured those. In the matter of the trust, I cannot speak at
      all. The idea is hateful to me, personally. All such combinations excite
      my anger. But as a business operation it may improve your property; always
      assuming that you are capably and fairly represented in the control of the
      trust. I suppose Mr. Boyce has attended to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; broke in the girl, &ldquo;it is all Mr. Boyce! It is to be
      assumed that he will do this, to be taken for granted he will do that, to
      be hoped that he has done the other. <i>That</i> is what I am anxious
      about. <i>Has</i> he done these things? <i>Will</i> he do them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that, of course, is what I cannot tell you,&rdquo; said Reuben. &ldquo;How can I
      know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer knitted his ordinarily placid brows for a moment in thought.
      Then he slowly shook his head. &ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;I
      should be very angry if the railroad people, for example, set him to
      examining what I had done for them; angry with him, especially, for
      accepting such a commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. Tracy, if I seem to have proposed anything dishonorable
      to you,&rdquo; Miss Kate responded, with added formality in voice and manner. &ldquo;I
      did not mean to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I imagine such a thing?&rdquo; said Reuben, more readily than was his
      wont. &ldquo;I only sought to make a peculiar situation clear to you, who are
      not familiar with such things. If I asked him questions, or meddled in the
      matter at all, he would resent it; and by usage he would be justified in
      resenting it. That is how it stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you cannot help me, after all!&rdquo; She spoke despondingly now, with the
      low, rich vibration in her tone which Reuben had dwelt so often on in
      memory since he first heard it. &ldquo;And I had counted so much upon your aid,&rdquo;
       she added, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do a great deal to be of use to you,&rdquo; the young man said,
      earnestly, and looked her in the face with calm frankness; &ldquo;a great deal,
      Miss Minster, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that &lsquo;but&rsquo; means everything. I repeat, in this situation you can
      do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot take a brief against my partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not suggest that again, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; she interposed. &ldquo;I can see
      that I was wrong there, and you were right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it in that way. There was no question of wrong or right. I
      merely pointed out a condition of business relations which had not
      occurred to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is no other way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another way had dawned on Reuben&rsquo;s mind, but it was so bold and
      precipitous that he hesitated to consider it seriously at first. When it
      did take form and force itself upon him, he said, half quaking at his own
      audacity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other way&mdash;while&mdash;he remains my partner.&rdquo; Bright women
      discover many obscure things by the use of that marvellous faculty we call
      intuition, but they have by no means reduced its employment to an exact
      science. Sometimes their failure to discover more obvious things is
      equally remarkable. At this moment, for example, Kate&rsquo;s feminine wits did
      not in the least help her to read the mind of the man before her, or the
      meaning in his words. In truth, they misled her, for she heard only an
      obstinate reiteration of an unpleasant statement, and set her teeth
      together with impatience as she heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And had she even kept these teeth tight clinched, and said nothing, the
      man might have gone on in self-explanation, and made clear to her her
      mistake. But her vexation was too imperative for silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to have taken up your time, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; she said,
      stiffly, and rose from her chair. &ldquo;I am so little informed about these
      matters, I really imagined you could help us. Pray forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Reuben could have realized, as he stood in momentary embarrassment,
      that this beautiful lady before him had fairly bitten her tongue to
      restrain it from adding that he might treat this as a professional call,
      or in some other way suggesting that he would be paid for his time, he
      might have been more embarrassed still, and angry as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not occur to him to feel annoyance&mdash;at least, toward her.
      He really was sorry that no way of being of help to her seemed immediately
      available, and he thought of this more in fact than he did of the personal
      aspects of his failure to justify her invitation. He noted that the faint
      perfume which her dress exhaled as she rose was identical with that of the
      letter of invitation, and thought to himself that he would preserve that
      letter, and then that it would not be quite warranted by the
      circumstances, and so found himself standing silent before her, sorely
      reluctant to go away, and conscious that there must be a sympathetic light
      in his eyes which hers did not reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am truly grieved if you are disappointed,&rdquo; he managed to say at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is nothing, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; she said, politely, and moved toward the
      door. &ldquo;It was my ignorance of business rules. I am so sorry to have
      troubled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben followed her through the hall to the outer door, wondering if she
      would offer to shake hands with him, and putting both his stick and hat in
      his left hand to free the other in case she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the doorstep she did give him her hand, and in that moment, ruled by a
      flash of impulse, he heard himself saying to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything happens, if you learn anything, if you need me, you <i>won&rsquo;t</i>
      fail to call me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the door closed, and as Reuben walked away he did not seem able to
      recall whether she had answered his appeal or not. In sober fact, it had
      scarcely sounded like his appeal at all. The voice was certainly one which
      had never been heard in the law-office down on Main Street or in the
      trial-chamber of the Dearborn County Court-House over the way. It had
      sounded more like the voice of an actor in the theatre&mdash;like a Romeo
      murmuring up to the sweet girl in the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben walked straight to his office, and straight through to the little
      inner apartment appropriated to his private uses. There were some people
      in the large room talking with his partner, but he scarcely observed their
      presence as he passed. He unlocked a tiny drawer in the top of his desk,
      cleared out its contents brusquely, dusted the inside with his hand
      kerchief, and then placed within it a perfumed note which he took from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had turned the key upon this souvenir, he drew a long breath,
      lighted a cigar, and sat down, with his feet on the table and his thoughts
      among the stars.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>euben allowed his
      mind to drift at will in this novel, enchanted channel for a long time,
      until the clients outside had taken their departure, and his cigar had
      burned out, and his partner had sauntered in to mark by some casual talk
      the fact that the day was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      What this mind shaped into dreams and desires and pictures in its musings,
      it would not be an easy matter to detail. The sum of the revery&mdash;or,
      rather, the central goal up to which every differing train of thought
      somehow managed to lead him&mdash;was that Kate Minster was the most
      beautiful, the cleverest, the dearest, the loveliest, the most to be
      adored and longed for, of all mortal women.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he did not say to himself, in so many words, &ldquo;I love her,&rdquo; it was
      because the phraseology was unfamiliar to him. That eternal triplet of
      tender verb and soulful pronouns, which sings itself in our more
      accustomed hearts to music set by the stress of our present senses&mdash;now
      the gay carol of springtime, sure and confident; now the soft twilight
      song, wherein the very weariness of bliss sighs forth a blessing; now the
      vibrant, wooing ballad of a graver passion, with tears close underlying
      rapture; now, alas! the dirge of hopeless loss, with wailing chords which
      overwhelm like curses, smitten upon heartstrings strained to the breaking&mdash;these
      three little words did not occur to him. But no lover self-confessed could
      have dreamed more deliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken with her twice now&mdash;once when she was wrapped in furs
      and wore a bonnet, and once in her own house, where she was dressed in a
      creamy white gown, with a cord and tassels about the waist. These details
      were tangible possessions in the treasure-house of his memory. The first
      time she had charmed and gratified his vague notions of what a beautiful
      and generous woman should be; he had been unspeakably pleased by the
      enthusiasm with which she threw herself into the plan for helping the poor
      work-girls of the town. On this second occasion she had been concerned
      only about the safety of her own money, and that of her family, and yet
      his liking for her had flared up into something very like a consuming
      flame. If there was a paradox here, the lawyer did not see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There floated across his mind now and again stray black motes of
      recollection that she had not seemed altogether pleased with him on this
      later occasion, but they passed away without staining the bright colors of
      his meditation. It did not matter what she had thought or said. The fact
      of his having been there with her, the existence of that little perfumed
      letter tenderly locked up in the desk before him, the breathing, smiling,
      dark-eyed picture of her which glowed in his brain&mdash;these were
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once before&mdash;once only in his life&mdash;the personality of a woman
      had seized command of his thoughts. Years ago, when he was still the
      schoolteacher at the Burfield, he had felt himself in love with Annie
      Fairchild, surely the sweetest flower that all the farm-lands of Dearborn
      had ever produced. He had come very near revealing his heart&mdash;doubtless
      the girl did know well enough of his devotion&mdash;but she was in love
      with her cousin Seth, and Reuben had come to realize this, and so had
      never spoken, but had gone away to New York instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could remember that for a time he was unhappy, and even so late as last
      autumn, after nearly four years had gone by, the mere thought that she
      commended her protégée, Jessica Lawton, to his kindness, had thrilled him
      with something of the old feeling. But now she seemed all at once to have
      faded away into indistinct remoteness, like the figure of some little girl
      he had known in his boyhood and had never seen since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, the apparition of Jessica Law-ton rose and took form in
      his thoughts, as that of Annie Fairchild passed into the shadows of long
      ago. She, at least, was not a schoolgirl any more, but a full-grown woman.
      He could remember that the glance in her eyes when she looked at him was
      maturely grave and searching. She had seemed very grateful to him for
      calling upon her, and he liked to recall the delightful expression of
      surprised satisfaction which lighted up her face when she found that both
      Miss Minster and he would help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minster and himself! They two were to work together to further and
      fulfil this plan of Jessica&rsquo;s! Oh, the charm of the thought!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he came to think of it, the young lady had never said a word to-day
      about Jessica and the plan&mdash;and, oddly enough, too, he had never once
      remembered it either. But then Miss Minster had other matters on her mind.
      She was frightened about the mortgages and the trust, and anxious to have
      his help to set her fears at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben began to wonder once more what there was really in those fears. As
      he pondered on this, all the latent distrust of his partner which had been
      growing up for weeks in his mind suddenly swelled into a great dislike.
      There came to him, all at once, the recollection of those mysterious and
      sinister words he had overheard exchanged between his partner and Tenney,
      and it dawned upon his slow-working consciousness that that strange talk
      about a &ldquo;game in his own hands&rdquo; had never been explained by events. Then,
      in an instant, he realized instinctively that here <i>was</i> the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture that Horace strolled into the presence of his
      partner. He had his hands in his trousers pockets, and a cigar between his
      teeth. This latter he now proceeded to light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferguson has been here again,&rdquo; he said, nonchalantly, &ldquo;and brought his
      brother with him. He can&rsquo;t make up his mind whether to appeal the case or
      not. He&rsquo;d like to try it, but the expense scares him. I told him at last
      that I was tired of hearing about the thing, and didn&rsquo;t give a damn what
      he did, as long as he only shut up and gave me a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben did not feel interested in the Fergusons. He looked his partner
      keenly, almost sternly, in the eye, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never mentioned to me that Mrs. Minster had put her business in
      your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace flushed a little, and returned the other&rsquo;s gaze with one equally
      truculent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem to be necessary,&rdquo; he replied, curtly. &ldquo;It is private
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing was said about your having private business when the firm was
      established,&rdquo; commented Reuben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; retorted Horace. &ldquo;But you have your railroad affairs&mdash;a
      purely personal matter. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I have an equal right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say you haven&rsquo;t. What I am thinking of is your secrecy in the
      matter. I hate to have people act in that way, as if I couldn&rsquo;t be
      trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace had never heard Reuben speak in this tone before. The whole Minster
      business had perplexed and harassed him into a state of nervous
      irritability these last few weeks, and it was easy for him now to snap at
      provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least <i>I</i> may be trusted to mind my own affairs,&rdquo; he said, with
      cutting niceness of enunciation and a lowering scowl of the brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a little pause, for Reuben saw himself face to face with a
      quarrel, and shrank from precipitating it needlessly. Perhaps the rupture
      would be necessary, but he would do nothing to hasten it out of mere
      ill-temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the point,&rdquo; he said at last, looking up with more calmness
      into the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I simply commented on your having taken such pains
      to keep the whole thing from me. Why on earth should you have thought that
      essential?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace answered with a question. &ldquo;Who told you about it?&rdquo; he asked, in a
      surly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old &rsquo;Squire Gedney mentioned it first. Others have spoken of it
      since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what am I to understand? Do you intend to object to my keeping the
      business? I may tell you that it was by the special request of my clients
      that I undertook it alone, and, as they laid so much stress on that, it
      seemed to me best not to speak of it at all to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be frank,&rdquo; said Horace, with a cold gleam in his eye, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      imagine that it would be particularly pleasant to you to learn that the
      Minster ladies desired not to have you associated with their affairs. It
      seemed one of those things best left unsaid. However, you have it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben felt the disagreeable intention of his partner&rsquo;s words even more
      than he did their bearing upon the dreams from which he had been awakened.
      He had by this time perfectly made up his mind about Horace, and realized
      that a break-up was inevitable. The conviction that this young man was
      dishonest carried with it, however, the suggestion that it would be wise
      to probe him and try to learn what he was at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would sit down a minute or two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to talk to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace took a chair, and turned the cigar restlessly around in his teeth.
      He was conscious that his nerves were not quite what they should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; pursued Reuben&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking as an older lawyer
      than you, and an older man&mdash;it seems to me that to put a four hundred
      thousand dollar mortgage on the Minster property is a pretty big
      undertaking for a young man to go into on his own hook, without consulting
      anybody. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. Don&rsquo;t think I wish to meddle. Only it
      seems to me, if I had been in your place, I should have moved very
      cautiously and taken advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did take advice,&rdquo; said Horace. The discovery that Reuben knew of this
      mortgage filled him with uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom? Schuyler Tenney?&rdquo; asked Reuben, speaking calmly enough, but
      watching with all his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chance shot went straight to the mark. Horace visibly flushed, and
      then turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline to be catechised in this way,&rdquo; he said, nervously shifting his
      position on the chair, and then suddenly rising. &ldquo;Gedney is a damned,
      meddlesome, drunken old fool,&rdquo; he added, with irrelevant vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid &lsquo;Cal&rsquo; does drink too much,&rdquo; answered Reuben, with perfect
      amiability of tone. He evinced no desire to continue the conversation, and
      Horace, after standing for an uncertain moment or two in the doorway, went
      out and put on his overcoat. Then he came back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to take it that you object to my continuing to act as attorney for
      these ladies?&rdquo; he asked from the threshold of the outer room, his voice
      shaking a little in spite of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have said that,&rdquo; replied Reuben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t <i>said</i> it,&rdquo; commented the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, I haven&rsquo;t quite cleared up in my own mind just what I
      do object to, or how much,&rdquo; said Reuben, relighting his cigar, and
      contemplating his boots crossed on the desk-top. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk of this
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; muttered young Mr. Boyce. Then he turned, and went away
      without saying good-night. The outer door slammed behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight began to close in upon the winter&rsquo;s day, but Reuben still sat in
      meditation. He had parted with his colleague in anger, and it was evident
      enough that the office family was to be broken up; but he gave scarcely a
      thought to these things. His mind, in fact, seemed by preference to dwell
      chiefly upon the large twisted silken cord which girdled the waist of that
      wonderful young woman, and the tasselled ends of which hung against the
      white front of her gown like the beads of a nun. Many variant thoughts
      about her affairs, about her future, rose in his mind and pleasantly
      excited it, but they all in turn merged vaguely into fancies circling
      around that glossy rope and weaving themselves into its strands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very near tea-time, and darkness had established itself for the
      night in the offices, before Reuben&rsquo;s vagrant musings prompted him to
      action. Upon the spur of the moment, he all at once put down his feet,
      lighted the gas over his desk, took out the perfumed letter from its
      consecrated resting-place, and began hurriedly to write a reply to it. He
      had suddenly realized that the memorable interview that afternoon had
      been, from her point of view, inconclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five times he worked his way down nearly to the bottom of the page, and
      then tore up the sheet. At first he was too expansive; then the contrasted
      fault of over-reticence jarred upon him. At last he constructed this
      letter, which obtained a reluctant approval from his critical sense,
      though it seemed to his heart a pitifully gagged and blindfolded missive:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Miss Minster: Unfortunately, I was unable this afternoon to see my
      way to helping you upon the lines which you suggested. I am afraid that
      this disappointed you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters have assumed a somewhat different aspect since our talk. By the
      time that you have mastered the details of what you had on your mind, I
      may be in a position to consult with you freely upon the whole subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want you to believe that I am very anxious to be of assistance to you,
      in this as in all other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faithfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben TRacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben locked up the keepsake note again, fondly entertaining the idea as
      he did so that soon there might be others to bear it company. Then he
      closed the offices, went down upon the street, and told the first idle boy
      he met that he could earn fifty cents by carrying a letter at once to the
      home of the Minsters. The money would be his when he returned to the
      Dearborn House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there be any answer?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opened up a new idea to the lawyer. &ldquo;You might wait and see,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the messenger came back in a depressingly short space of time, with
      the word that no answer was required.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hurried both ways with a stem concentration of purpose, and now he
      dashed off once more in an even more strenuous face against time with the
      half-dollar clutched securely inside his mitten. The Great Occidental
      Minstrel Combination was in town, and the boy leaped over snowbanks, and
      slid furiously across slippery places, in the earnestness of his intention
      not to miss one single joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big man whom he left went wearily up the stairs to his room, and
      walked therein for aimless hours, and almost scowled as he shook his head
      at the waitress who came up to remind him that he had had no supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Minster sisters had read Reuben&rsquo;s note together, in the seclusion
      of their own sitting-room. They had previously discussed the fact of his
      refusal to assist them&mdash;for so it translated itself in Kate&rsquo;s account
      of the interview&mdash;and had viewed it with almost displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was, however, disposed to relent when the letter came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least it might be well to write him a polite note,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;thanking him, and saying that circumstances might arise under which you
      would be glad to&mdash;to avail yourself, and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall write at all,&rdquo; Kate replied, glancing over the
      lawyer&rsquo;s missive again. &ldquo;He took no interest in the thing whatever. And
      you see how even now he infers that &lsquo;the lines I suggested&rsquo; were
      dishonorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see that, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is. &lsquo;He was unable to see his way,&rsquo; and that sort of thing. And
      he <i>said</i> himself that the business all seemed regular enough, so far
      as he could see.&mdash;Say that there is no answer,&rdquo; she added to the maid
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls sat in silence for a moment in the soft, cosey light between
      the fire-place and the lace-shaded lamp. Then Ethel spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really didn&rsquo;t like him, Kate? You know you were so enthusiastic
      about him, that day you came back from the milliner&rsquo;s shop. I never heard
      you have so much to say about any other man before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was different,&rdquo; mused the other. Her voice grew even less kindly,
      and the words came swifter as she went on. &ldquo;<i>Then</i> it was a question
      of helping the Lawton girl. He was quite excited about <i>that</i>. He
      didn&rsquo;t hum and haw, and talk about &lsquo;the lines suggested&rsquo; to him, then. He
      could &lsquo;see his way&rsquo; very clearly indeed. Oh, yes, with entire clearness!
      And I was childish enough to be taken in by it all. I am vexed with myself
      when I think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you are being quite fair, Kate?&rdquo; pale Ethel asked, putting
      her hand caressingly on the sister&rsquo;s knee. &ldquo;Read the letter again, dear.
      He <i>says</i> he wants to help you; and he hints, too, that something has
      happened, or is going to happen, to make him free in the matter. How can
      we tell what that something is, or how he felt himself bound before? It
      seems to me that we oughtn&rsquo;t to leap at the idea of his being unfriendly.
      I am sure that you believed him to be a wholly good man before. Why assume
      all at once now that he is not, just because&mdash;Men don&rsquo;t change from
      good to bad like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but <i>was</i> he good before, or did we only think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel went on: &ldquo;Surely, he knows more about business than we do. And if he
      was unable to help you, it must have been for some real reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is <i>it!</i> I should like to be helped first, and let reasons come
      afterward.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s dark eyes flashed with an imperious light. &ldquo;What
      kind of a hero is it who, when you cry for assistance, calmly says: &lsquo;Upon
      the lines you suggest I do not see my way&rsquo;? It is high time the books
      about chivalry were burned, if &lsquo;that&rsquo; is the modern man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did not cry to a hero for assistance. You merely asked the advice
      of a lawyer about a mortgage&mdash;-if mamma is right about its being a
      mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same thing,&rdquo; said Kate, pushing the hassock impatiently with
      her foot.. &ldquo;Whether the distressed maiden falls into the water or into
      debt, the principle is precisely the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t do what you asked, because it would be unfair to his partner.
      Now, isn&rsquo;t that it exactly? And wasn&rsquo;t that honorable? Now, <i>be</i>
      frank, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The partner would have gone into anything headlong, asking no questions,
      raising no objections, if I had so much ais lifted my finger. He never
      would have given, partner a thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate, confided this answer to the firelight. She was conscious of a desire
      just now not to meet her sister&rsquo;s glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you like the man without scruples better than the man with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, he is more interesting,&rdquo; the elder girl said, still with her
      eyes on the burning logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel waited a little for some additional hint as to her sister&rsquo;s state of
      mind. When the silence had begun to make itself felt, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate Minster, you don&rsquo;t mean one word of what you are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; listen to me. You really in your heart respect Mr. Tracy very much
      for his action to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For being so much less eager to help me than he was to help the
      milliner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for not being willing to help even you by doing an unfair thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if you like&mdash;respect, yes. But so one respects John Knox,
      and Increase Mather, and St. Simon What&rsquo;s-his-name on top of the pillar&mdash;all
      the disagreeable people, in fact. But it isn&rsquo;t respect that makes the
      world go round. There is such a thing as caring too much for respect, and
      too little for warmth of feeling, and generous impulses, and&mdash;and so
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer girl, Kate,&rdquo; was all Ethel could think to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the silence maintained itself so long that the snapping of
      sparks on the hearth, and even the rushing suction of air in the
      lamp-flame, grew to be obvious noises. At last Ethel slid softly from the
      couch to the carpet, and nestled her head against her sister&rsquo;s waist. Kate
      put her arm tenderly over the girl&rsquo;s shoulder, and drew her closer to her,
      and the silence had become vocal with affectionate mur-murings to them
      both. It was the younger sister who finally spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>won&rsquo;t</i> do anything rash, Kate? Nothing without talking it over
      with me?&rdquo; she pleaded, almost sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate bent over and kissed her twice, thrice, on the forehead, and stroked
      the silken hair upon this forehead caressingly. Her own eyes glistened
      with the beginnings of tears before she made answer, rising as she spoke,
      and striving to import into her voice the accent of gayety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I ever dreamed of doing anything at all without asking you! And
      please, puss, may I go to bed now?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;HORACE&rsquo;S PATH BECOMES TORTUOUS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tracy has found out that I&rsquo;m doing the Minster business, and he&rsquo;s cut up
      rough about it. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the firm came a cropper over
      the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace Boyce confided this information to Mr. Schuyler Tenney on the
      forenoon following his scene with Reuben, and though the language in which
      it was couched was in part unfamiliar, the hardware merchant had no
      difficulty in grasping its meaning. He stopped his task of going through
      the morning&rsquo;s batch of business letters, and looked up keenly at the young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found out&mdash;how do you mean? I told you to tell him&mdash;told you
      the day you came here to talk about the General&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; Tenney demanded, sharply. &ldquo;I should like to know why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it didn&rsquo;t suit me to do so,&rdquo; replied the young man; &ldquo;just as it
      doesn&rsquo;t suit me now to be bullied about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney looked for just a fleeting instant as if he were going to
      respond in kind. Then he thought better of it, and began toying with one
      of the envelopes before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning,&rdquo; he
      said, smilingly. &ldquo;Why, man alive, nobody dreamed of bullying you. Only, of
      course, it would have been better if you&rsquo;d told Tracy. And you say he is
      mad about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was deucedly offensive. I daresay it will come to an open row. I
      haven&rsquo;t seen him yet to-day, but things looked very dickey indeed for the
      partnership last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the firm hasn&rsquo;t got any specified term to run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is terminable at pleasure of both parties, which of course means
      either party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there, you can tell him to go to the old Harry, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely what I mean to do&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is going to be enough in this Minster business to keep me going
      in the mean while. I don&rsquo;t think I could take much of his regular office
      business away. I haven&rsquo;t been there long enough, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough? I Should think there <i>would</i> be enough! You will have five
      thousand dollars as her representative in the Thessaly Manufacturing
      Company. I daresay you might charge something for acting as her agent in
      the pig-iron trust, too, though I&rsquo;d draw it pretty mild if I were you.
      Women get scared at bills for that sort of thing. A young fellow like you
      ought to save money on half of five thousand dollars. It never cost me
      fifteen hundred dollars yet to live, and live well, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace smiled in turn, and the smile was felt by both to suffice, without
      words. There was no need to express in terms the fact that in matters of
      necessary expense a Boyce and a Tenney, were two widely differentiated
      persons. Only perhaps. Horace had more satisfaction out of the thought
      than did his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I ought to tell you, Tracy knows in some way
      that you are mixed up with me in the thing. He mentioned your name&mdash;in
      that slow, ox-like way of his so that I couldn&rsquo;t tell how much he knew or
      suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney was interested in this; and showed his concern by separating
      the letters on his desk into little piles, as if he were preparing to
      perform a card tricks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it won&rsquo;t matter, much,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s going to
      know it pretty soon, now.&rdquo; He thought again for a little, and then added:
      &ldquo;Only, on second thought, you&rsquo;d better stick in with him a while longer,
      if you can. Make some sort of apology to him, if he needs one, and keep in
      the firm. It will be better so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I, pray?&rdquo; demanded the young man, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tenney again looked momentarily as if he were tempted to reply with
      acerbity, and again the look vanished as swiftly as it came. He answered
      in all mildness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want Tracy to be sniffing around, inquiring into things,
      until we are fairly in the saddle. He might spoil everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how will my remaining with him prevent that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know your man,&rdquo; replied Tenney. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of those fellows who
      would feel in honor bound to keep his hands off, simply because you <i>were</i>
      with him. That&rsquo;s the beauty of that kind of chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This tribute to the moral value of his partner impressed Horace but
      faintly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see how he talks to-day,&rdquo; he said, doubtfully.
      &ldquo;Perhaps we can manage to hit it off together a while longer.&rdquo; Then a
      thought crossed his mind, and he asked with abruptness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you afraid of his finding out, if he does &lsquo;sniff around&rsquo; as you
      call it? What is there to find out? Everything is above board, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know it is. Who should know it better than you?&rdquo; Mr. Tenney
      responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace reasoned to himself as he walked away that there really was no
      cause for apprehension. Tenney was smart, and evidently Wendover was smart
      too, but if they tried to pull the wool over his eyes they would find that
      he himself had not been born yesterday. He had done everything they had
      suggested to him, but he felt that the independent and even captious
      manner in which he had done it all must have shown the schemers that he
      was not a man to be trifled with. Thus far he could see no dishonesty in
      their plans. He had been very nervous about the first steps, but his mind
      was almost easy now. He was in a position where he could protect the
      Minsters if any harm threatened them. And very soon now, he said
      confidently to himself, he would be in an even more enviable position&mdash;that
      of a member of the family council, a prospective son-in-law. It was clear
      to his perceptions that Kate liked him, and that he had no rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that Reuben did not refer again to the subject of yesterday&rsquo;s
      dispute, and while Horace acquiesced in the silence, he was conscious of
      some disappointment over it. It annoyed him to even look at his partner
      this morning, and he was sick and tired of the partnership. It required an
      effort to be passing civil with Reuben, and he said to himself a hundred
      times during the day that he should be heartily glad when the Thessaly
      Manufacturing Company got its new machinery in, and began real operations,
      so that he could take up his position there as the visible agent of the
      millions, and pitch his partner and the pettifogging law business
      overboard altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the afternoon he went to the residence of the Minsters.
      The day was not Tuesday, but Horace regarded himself as emancipated from
      formal conditions, and at the door asked for the ladies, and then made his
      own way into the drawing-room, with entire self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Minster came down, he had some trivial matter of business ready
      as a pretext for his visit, but her manner was so gracious that he felt
      pleasantly conscious of the futility of pretexts. He was on such a footing
      in the Minster household that he would never need excuses any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady herself mentioned the plan of his attending the forthcoming
      meeting of the directors of the pig-iron trust at Pittsburg, and told him
      that she had instructed her bankers to deposit with his bankers a lump sum
      for expenses chargeable against the estate, which he could use at
      discretion. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be asked to use your own money on our business,&rdquo;
       she said, smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only natural to warm toward people who have such nice things as this
      to say, and Horace found himself assuming a very confidential, almost
      filial, attitude toward Mrs. Minster. Her kindness to him was so marked
      that he felt really moved by it, and in a gracefully indirect way said so.
      He managed this by alluding to his own mother, who had died when he was a
      little boy, and then dwelling, with a tender inflection in his voice, upon
      the painful loneliness which young men feel who are brought up in
      motherless homes. &ldquo;It seems as if I had never known a home at all,&rdquo; he
      said, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was one of the Beekmans from Tyre, wasn&rsquo;t she? I&rsquo;ve heard Tabitha
      speak of her often,&rdquo; said Mrs. Minster. The words were not important, but
      the look which accompanied them was distinctly sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was this glance that affected Horace. He made a little gulping
      sound in his throat, clinched his hands together, and looked fixedly down
      upon the pattern of the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should both have been better men if she had lived&rsquo;,&rdquo; he murmured, in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As no answer came, he was forced to look up after a time, and then upon
      the instant he realized that his pathos had been wasted, for Mrs.
      Minster&rsquo;s face did not betray the emotion he had anticipated. She seemed
      to have been thinking of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen any Bermuda potatoes in the market yet?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      about time for them, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask my father,&rdquo; Horace replied, determined not to be thrown off the
      trail. &ldquo;He has been in the West Indies a good deal, and he knows all about
      their vegetables, and the seasons, and so on. It is about him that I wish
      to speak, Mrs. Minster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady nodded her head, and drew down the comers of her mouth a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel the homeless condition of the General very much,&rdquo; Horace went on.
      &ldquo;The death of my mother was a terrible blow to him, one he has never
      recovered from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster had heard differently, but she nodded her head again in
      sympathy with this new view. Horace had not been mistaken in believing
      that filial affection was good in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he has lived all these years almost alone in the big house,&rdquo; the son
      proceeded, &ldquo;and the solitary life has affected his spirits, weakened his
      ambition, relaxed his regard for the part he ought to play in the
      community. Since I have been back, he has brightened up a good deal. He
      has been a most loving father to me always, and I would do anything in the
      world to contribute to his happiness. It is borne in upon me more and more
      that if I had a cheerful home to which he could turn for warmth and
      sunshine, if I had a wife whom he could reverence and be fond of, if there
      were grandchildren to greet him when he came and to play upon his knee&mdash;he
      would feel once more as if there was something in life worth living for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace awaited with deep anxiety the answer to this. The General was the
      worst card in his hand, one which he was glad to be rid of at any risk. If
      it should turn out that it had actually taken a trick in the game, then he
      would indeed be lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is no offence, how old are you, Mr. Boyce?&rdquo; the lady asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be twenty-eight in April.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster seemed to approve the figures. &ldquo;I never have believed in
      early marriages,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They make more than half the trouble there
      is. The Mauverensens were never great hands for marrying early. My
      grandfather, Major Douw, was almost thirty, and my father was past that
      age. And, of course, people married then much earlier than they do
      nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you do not think twenty-eight too young,&rdquo; Horace pleaded, with
      alert eyes resting on her face. He paused only for an instant, and then,
      just as the tremor arising in his heart had reached his tongue, added
      earnestly, &ldquo;For it is a Mauverensen I wish to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster looked at him with no light of comprehension in her glance.
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be our people,&rdquo; she said, composedly, &ldquo;for Anthony has no
      daughters. It must be some of the Schenectady lot. We&rsquo;re not related at
      all. They try to make out that they are, but they&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very closely and tenderly related to the young lady I have
      learned to adore,&rdquo; the young man said, leaning forward on his low chair
      until one knee almost touched the carpet. &ldquo;I called her a Mauverensen
      because she is worthy of that historic blood, but it was her mother&rsquo;s, not
      her father&rsquo;s name. Mrs. Minster, I love your daughter Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me!&rdquo; was the astonished lady&rsquo;s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at the young man in suppliant attitude before her, in very
      considerable confusion of thought, and for what seemed to him an
      intolerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; she said first, doubtingly. Then she
      added, as if thinking aloud: &ldquo;I might have known Kate was keeping
      something from me. She hasn&rsquo;t been herself at all these last few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she has not been keeping <i>this</i> from you, Mrs. Minster,&rdquo; urged
      the young man, in his softest voice. &ldquo;It is my own secret&mdash;all my own&mdash;kept
      locked in the inner tabernacle of my heart until this very moment, when I
      revealed it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that Kate&mdash;my daughter&mdash;does not know of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must know that I worship the ground she treads on&mdash;she would be
      blind not to realize that&mdash;but I have never said a word to her about
      it. No, not a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster uttered the little monosyllable &ldquo;oh!&rdquo; with a hesitating,
      long-drawn-out sound. It was evident that this revelation altered matters
      in her mind, and Horace hurried on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the relation between mother and child has always seemed to
      pie the most sacred thing on earth&mdash;perhaps because my own mother
      died so many, many years ago. I would rather stifle my own feelings than
      let an act of mine desecrate or imperil that relation. It may be that I am
      old-fashioned, Mrs. Minster,&rdquo; the young man continued, with a deprecatory
      smile, &ldquo;but I like the old habit of the good families&mdash;that of
      deferring to the parents. I say that to them the chief courtesy and
      deference are due. I know it is out of date, but I have always felt that
      way. So I speak to you first. I say to you with profound respect that you
      have reared the loveliest and best of all the daughters of the sons of
      men, and that if you will only entertain the idea of permitting me to
      strive to win her love, I shall be the proudest and happiest mortal on
      earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might betide with the daughter, the conquest of the mother was
      easy and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your sentiments very much indeed,&rdquo; she said, with evident
      sincerity. &ldquo;And I like you too. I may as well tell you so. Of course I
      haven&rsquo;t the least idea what Kate will say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave that to me!&rdquo; said Horace, with ardent confidence. Then, after
      this rapturous outburst, he went on more quietly: &ldquo;I would beg of you not
      to mention the subject to her. I think that would be best. Your favor has
      allowed me to come and go here on pleasant terms of friendship. Let these
      terms not be altered. I will not ask your daughter to commit herself until
      she has had time and chance to know me through and through. It would not
      be fair to her otherwise. To pick a husband is the one grand, irrevocable
      step in a young girl&rsquo;s life. Its success means bliss, content, sunshine;
      its failure means all that is the reverse. Therefore, I say, she cannot
      have too much information, too many advantages, to help her in her
      choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came to be understood that Mrs. Minster was to say nothing, and
      was not to seem to make more of Horace than she had previously done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he bowed over her hand and lightly kissed it, in a fashion which the
      good lady fondly assumed to be European, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in a semi-dazed
      abstraction of mental power, from time to time fitfully remembering some
      wealthy young man whom she had vaguely considered as a possible
      son-in-law, and sighing impartially over each mustached and shirt-fronted
      figure as she pushed it out into the limbo of the might-have-been. She
      almost groaned once when she recalled that this secret must be kept even
      from her friend Tabitha.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Horace, he walked on air. The marvel of his great success
      surrounded and lifted him, as angels bear the souls of the blessed
      fleeting from earth in the artist&rsquo;s dream. The young Bonaparte, home from
      Italy and the reproduction of Hannibal&rsquo;s storied feat, with Paris on its
      knees before him and France resounding with his name, could not have swung
      his shoulders more proudly, or gazed upon unfolding destiny with a more
      exultant confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way homeward an instinctive desire to be alone with his joy led him
      to choose unfrequented streets, and on one of these he passed a milliner&rsquo;s
      shop which he had never seen before. He would not have noted it now, save
      that his eye was unconsciously caught by some stray freak of color in the
      window where bonnets were displayed. Then, still unconsciously, his vision
      embraced the glass door beside this window, and there suddenly it was
      arrested and turned to a bewildered stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk of the little shop nothing could be distinguished but two
      figures which stood close by the door. The dying light from the western
      sky, ruddily brilliant and penetrating in its final glow, fell full upon
      the faces of these two as they were framed in profile by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was the face of Kate Minster, the woman he was to wed. The other was
      the face of Jessica Law-ton, the woman whose life he had despoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace realized nothing else so swiftly as that he had not been seen, and,
      with an instinctive lowering of the head and a quickened step, he passed
      on. It was not until he had got out of the street altogether that he
      breathed a long breath and was able to think. Then he found himself
      trembling with excitement, as if he had been through a battle or a burning
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflection soon helped his nerves to quietude again. Evidently the girl
      had opened a millinery shop, and evidently Miss Minster was buying a
      bonnet of her. That was all there was of it, and surely there was no
      earthly cause for perturbation in that. The young man had thought so
      lightly of the Law-ton incident at Thanksgiving time that it had never
      since occurred to him to ask Tracy about its sequel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to his mind now that Tracy had probably helped her to start the
      shop. &ldquo;Damn Tracy!&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was nothing to be uneasy about in the casual, commercial meeting
      of these two women. He became quite clear on this point as he strode along
      toward home. At his next meeting with Kate it might do no harm to mention
      having seen her there in passing, and to drop a hint as to the character
      of the girl whom she was dealing with. He would see how the talk shaped
      itself, after the Law-ton woman&rsquo;s name had been mentioned. It was a great
      nuisance, her coming to Thessaly, anyway. He didn&rsquo;t wish her any special
      harm, but if she got in his way here she should be crushed like an insect.
      But, pshaw! it was silly to conceive injury or embarrassment coming from
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with a laugh he dismissed the subject from his thoughts, and went home
      to dine with his father, and gladdened the General&rsquo;s heart by a more or
      less elaborated account of the day&rsquo;s momentous event, in complete
      forgetfulness of the shock he had had.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dead of the night, however, he did think of it again with a
      vengeance. He awoke screaming, and cold with frightened quakings, under
      the spell of some hideous nightmare. When he thought upon them, the
      terrors of his dream were purely fantastic and could not be shaped into
      any kind of coherent form. But the profile of the Lawton girl seemed to be
      a part of all these terrors, a twisted and elongated side-face, with
      staring, empty eyes and lips down-drawn like those of the Medusa&rsquo;s head,
      and yet, strangely enough, with a certain shifting effect of beauty upon
      it all under the warm light of a winter sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace lay a long time awake, deliberately striving to exorcise this
      repellent countenance by fixing his thoughts upon the other face&mdash;the
      strong, beautiful, queenly face of the girl who was to be his wife. But he
      could not bring up before his mind&rsquo;s eye this picture that he wanted, and
      he could not drive the other away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep came again somehow, and there were no more bad dreams to be
      remembered. In the morning Horace did not even recall very distinctly the
      episode of the nightmare, but he discovered some novel threads of gray at
      his temple as he brushed his hair, and for the first time in his life,
      too, he took a drink of spirits before breakfast.

      CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;A VEHEMENT RESOLVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sloppy snow
      went away at last, and the reluctant frost was forced to follow, yet not
      before it had wreaked its spite by softening all the country roads into
      dismal swamps of mud, and heaving into painful confusion of holes and
      hummocks the pavements on Thessaly&rsquo;s main streets. But in compensation the
      birds came back, and the crocus and hyacinth showed themselves, and buds
      warmed to life again along the tender silk-brown boughs and melted into
      the pale bright green of a springs new foliage. Overcoats disappeared, and
      bare-legged boys with poles and strings of fish dawned upon the vision.
      The air was laden with the perfume of lilacs and talk about baseball.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this to midsummer seemed but a step. The factory workmen walked more
      wearily up the hill in the heat to their noonday dinners; lager-beer kegs
      advanced all at once to be the chief staple of freight traffic at the
      railway dépôt. People who could afford to take travelling vacations began
      to make their plans or to fulfil them, and those who could not began
      musing pleasantly upon the charms of hop-picking in September. And then,
      lo! it was autumn, and young men added with pride another unit to the sum
      of their age, and their mothers and sisters secretly subtracted such
      groups or fractions of units as were needful, and felt no more compunction
      at thus hoodwinking Time than if he had been a customs-officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village of Thessaly, which like a horizon encompassed most of the
      individuals whom we know, could tell little more than this of the months
      that had passed since Thanksgiving Day, now once again the holiday closest
      at hand. The seasons of rest and open-air amusement lay behind it, and in
      front was a vista made of toil. There had been many deaths, and still more
      numerous births, and none in either class mattered much save under the
      roof-tree actually blessed or afflicted. The year had been fairly
      prosperous, and the legislature had passed the bill which at New Year&rsquo;s
      would enable the village to call itself a city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the people with whom this story is concerned, there is scarcely more to
      record during this lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica Lawton was perhaps the one most conscious of change. At the very
      beginning of spring, indeed on the very day when Horace had his momentary
      fright in passing the shop, Miss Minster had visited her, had brought a
      reasonably comprehensive plan for the Girls&rsquo; Resting House, as she wanted
      it called, and had given her a considerable sum of money to carry out this
      plan. For a long time it puzzled Jessica a good deal that Miss Minster
      never came again. The scheme took on tangible form; some score of
      work-girls availed themselves of its privileges, and the result thus far
      involved less friction and more substantial success than Jessica had dared
      to expect. It seemed passing strange that Miss Minster, who had been so
      deeply enthusiastic at first, should never have cared to come and see the
      enterprise, now that it was in working order. Once or twice Miss Tabitha
      had dropped in, and professed to be greatly pleased with everything, but
      even in her manner there was an indefinable alteration which forbade
      questions about the younger lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were rumors about in the town which might have helped Jessica to an
      explanation had they reached her. The village gossips did not fail to note
      that the Minster family made a much longer sojourn this year at Newport,
      and then at Brick Church, New Jersey, than they had ever done before; and
      gradually the intelligence sifted about that young Horace Boyce had spent
      a considerable portion of his summer vacation with them. Thessaly could
      put two and two together as well as any other community. The understanding
      little by little spread its way that Horace was going to marry into the
      Minster millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there were repinings over this foreseen event, they were carefully
      dissembled. People who knew the young man liked him well enough. His
      professional record was good, and he had made a speech on the Fourth of
      July which pleased everybody except &rsquo;Squire Gedney; but then, the
      spiteful old &ldquo;Cal&rdquo; never liked anybody&rsquo;s speeches save his own. Even more
      satisfaction was felt, however, on the score of the General. His son was a
      showy young fellow, smart and well-dressed, no doubt, but perhaps a trifle
      too much given to patronizing folks who had not been to Europe, and did
      not scrub themselves all over with cold water, and put on a clean shirt
      with both collar and cuffs attached, every morning. But for the General
      there was a genuine affection. It pleased Thessaly to note that, since he
      had begun to visit at the home of the Minsters, other signs of social
      rehabilitation had followed, and that he himself drank less and led a more
      orderly life than of yore. When his intimates jokingly congratulated him
      on the rumors of his son&rsquo;s good fortune, the General tacitly gave them
      confirmation by his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Jessica had heard these reports, she might have traced at once to its
      source Miss Minster&rsquo;s sudden and inexplicable coolness. Not hearing them,
      she felt grieved and perplexed for a time, and then schooled herself into
      resignation as she recalled Reuben Tracy&rsquo;s warning about the way rich
      people took up whims and dropped them again, just as fancy dictated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the first day of November that the popular rumor as to Horace&rsquo;s
      prospects reached her, and this was a day memorable for vastly more
      important occurrences in the history of industrial Thessaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return of cold weather had been marked, among other signs of the
      season, by a renewed disposition on the part of Ben Lawton to drop in to
      the millinery shop, and sit around by the fire in the inner room. Ben came
      this day somewhat earlier than usual&mdash;the midday meal was in its
      preliminary stages of preparation under Lucinda&rsquo;s red hands&mdash;and it
      was immediately evident that he was more excited over something that had
      happened outside than by his expectation of getting a dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the very old Nick to pay down in the village!&rdquo; he said, as he put
      his feet on the stove-hearth. &ldquo;Heard about it, any of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben had scarcely ascended in the social scale during the scant year that
      had passed, though the general average of whiteness in his paper collars
      had somewhat risen, and his hair and straggling dry-mud-colored beard were
      kept more duly under the subjection of shears. His clothes, too, were
      whole and unworn, but they hung upon his slouching and round-shouldered
      figure with &ldquo;poor white&rdquo; written in every misfitting fold and on every
      bagging projection. Jessica had resigned all hope that he would ever be
      anything but a canal boatman in mien or ambition, but her affection for
      him had grown rather than diminished; and she was glad that Lucinda, in
      whom there had been more marked personal improvements, seemed also to like
      him better.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Jessica said, she had heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the Minster furnaces was all shut down this morning, and so was the
      work out at the ore-beds at Juno, and the men, boys, and girls in the
      Thessaly Company&rsquo;s mills all got word that wages was going to be cut down.
      You can bet there&rsquo;s a buzz around town, with them three things coming all
      together, smack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Jessica, still bending over her work of cleaning
      and picking out some plumes. &ldquo;That looks bad for business this winter,
      doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben&rsquo;s relations with business, or with industry generally, were of the
      most remote and casual sort, but he had a lively objective interest in the
      topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that ever happened,&rdquo; he said, with conviction.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s seven hundred men thrown out already&rdquo; (the figure was really two
      hundred and twelve), &ldquo;and more than a thousand more got to git unless
      they&rsquo;ll work for starvation wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems very hard,&rdquo; the girl made reply. The idea came to her that very
      possibly this would put an extra strain upon the facilities and financial
      strength of the Resting House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard!&rdquo; her father exclaimed, stretching his hands over the stove-top;
      &ldquo;them rich people are harder than Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart. What do them Minsters
      care about poor folks, whether they starve or freeze to death, or
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is the Minsters, you say!&rdquo; Jessica looked up now, with a new
      interest. &ldquo;Sure enough, they own the furnaces. How could they have done
      such a thing, with winter right ahead of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all to make more money,&rdquo; put in Lucinda. &ldquo;Them that don&rsquo;t need it&rsquo;ll
      do anything to get it. What do they care? That Kate Minster of yours, for
      instance, she&rsquo;ll wear her sealskin and eat pie just the same. What does it
      matter to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she has a good heart. I know she has,&rdquo; said Jessica. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t
      willingly do harm to any one. But perhaps she has nothing to do with
      managing such things. Yes, that must be it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Schuyler Tenney and Hod Boyce about run the thing, from what I
      hear,&rdquo; commented the father. &ldquo;Tenney&rsquo;s been bossing around since summer
      begun, and Boyce is the lawyer, so they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben suddenly stopped, and looked first at Jessica, then at Lucinda.
      Catching the latter&rsquo;s eye, he made furtive motions to her to leave the
      room; but she either did not or would not understand them, and continued
      stolidly at her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Kate you spoke about,&rdquo; he went on stum-blingly, nodding hints at
      Lucinda to go away as he spoke, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the tall girl, with the black eyes
      and her chin up in the air, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the two sisters answered, speaking together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I was saying about Hod Boyce,&rdquo; Ben said, and then stopped in
      evident embarrassment. Finally he added, confusedly avoiding Jessica&rsquo;s
      glance, &ldquo;&lsquo;Cindy, won&rsquo;t you jest step outside for a minute? I want to tell
      your sister something&mdash;something you don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows about Horace Boyce, father,&rdquo; said Jessica, flushing, but
      speaking calmly. &ldquo;There is no need of her going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda, however, wiped her hands on her apron, and went out into the
      store, shutting the door behind her. Then Ben, ostentatiously regarding
      the hands he held out over the stove, and turning them as if they had been
      fowls on a spit, sought hesitatingly for words with which to unbosom
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;as I was a-saying, Hod Boyce is the lawyer, and he&rsquo;s
      pretty thick with Schuyler Tenney, his father&rsquo;s partner, which, of course,
      is only natural; and Tenney he kind of runs the whole thing&mdash;and&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s it, don&rsquo;t you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t send Lucinda out in order to tell me <i>that</i>, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no. But Hod being the lawyer, as I said, why, don&rsquo;t you see, he has
      a good deal to say for himself with the women-folks, and he&rsquo;s been off
      with them down to the sea-side, and so it&rsquo;s come about that they say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say what?&rdquo; The girl had laid down her work altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s going to marry the girl you call Kate&mdash;the big one
      with the black eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The story was out. Jessica sat still under the revelation for a moment,
      and held up a restraining hand when her father offered to speak further.
      Then she rose and walked to and fro across the little room, in front of
      the stove where Ben sat, her hands hanging at her side and her brows bent
      with thought. At last she stopped before him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all over again about the stopping of the works&mdash;all you know
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben Lawton complied, and re-stated, with as much detail as he could
      command, the facts already exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl listened carefully, but with growing disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the notion had arisen in her mind that there would be something
      important in this story&mdash;something which it would be of use to
      understand. But her brain could make nothing significant out of this
      commonplace narrative of a lockout and a threatened dispute about wages.
      Gradually, as she thought, two things rose as certainties upon the surface
      of her reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That scoundrel is to blame for both things. He advised her to avoid me,
      and he advised her to do this other mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; Ben put in, deferentially. He felt a very
      humble individual indeed when his eldest daughter paced up and down and
      spoke in that tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m glad I know,&rdquo; she said, swiftly. She eyed her father in an
      abstracted way for an instant, and then added, as if thinking aloud:
      &ldquo;Well, then, my fine gentleman, you&mdash;simply&mdash;shall&mdash;<i>not</i>&mdash;marry
      Miss Minster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben moved uneasily in his seat, as if this warning had been personally
      addressed to him. &ldquo;It <i>would</i> be pretty rough, for a fact, wouldn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t <i>be</i> at all!&rdquo; she made emphatic answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as you can do much to pervent it, Jess,&rdquo; he ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I? <i>Cant</i> I!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with grim earnestness. &ldquo;Wait and
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben had waited all his life, and he proceeded now to take her at her word,
      sitting very still, and fixing a ruminative gaze on the side of the little
      stove. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, wrapped in silence and the placidity of
      contented suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jessica was now all eagerness and energy. She opened the store door,
      and called out to Lucinda with business-like decision of tone: &ldquo;Come in
      now, and hurry dinner up as fast as you can. I want to catch the 1.20
      train for Tecumseh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other two made no comment on this hasty resolve, but during the brief
      and not over-inviting meal which followed, watched their kinswoman with
      side-glances of uneasy surprise. The girl herself hastened through her
      dinner without a word of conversation, and then disappeared within the
      little chamber where she and Lucinda slept together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when she came out again, with her hat and cloak on and a
      little travelling-bag in her hand, that she felt impelled to throw some
      light on her intention. She took from her purse a bank-note and gave it to
      her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up the store at half-past four or five today,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and there
      are two things I want you to do for me outside. Go around the furniture
      stores, and get some kind of small sofa that will turn into a bed at
      night, and whatever extra bed-clothes we need for it&mdash;as cheap as you
      can. We&rsquo;ve got a pillow to spare, haven&rsquo;t we? You can put those two chairs
      out in the Resting House; that will make a place for the bed in this room.
      You must have it all ready when I get back to-morrow night. You needn&rsquo;t
      say anything to the girls, except that I am away for a day. And then&mdash;or
      no: <i>you</i> can do it better, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had spoken swiftly, but with ready precision. As she turned now
      to the wondering Ben, she lost something of her collected demeanor, and
      hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you&mdash;I want you to see Reuben Tracy, and ask him to come here
      at six to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. She deliberated upon this for an instant, and
      held out her hand as if she had changed her mind. Then she nodded, and
      said: &ldquo;Or no: tell him I will come to his office, and at six sharp. It
      will be better that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had perfunctorily kissed them both, and gone, silence fell upon
      the room. Ben took his pipe out of his pocket and looked at it with
      tentative longing, and then at the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go out in the yard and smoke, if you want to, but not in here,&rdquo;
       said Lucinda, promptly. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare think of such a thing if she
      were here,&rdquo; she added, with reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben put back his pipe and seated himself again by the fire. &ldquo;Mighty queer
      girl, that, eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When she gets stirred up, she&rsquo;s a hustler, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be she takes it from you,&rdquo; said Lucinda, with a modified grin of
      irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sarcasm fell short of its mark. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ben, with quiet candor,
      &ldquo;she gets it from my father. He used to count on licking a lock-tender
      somewhere along the canal every time he made a trip. I remember there was
      one particular fellow on the Montezuma Ma&rsquo;ash that he used to whale for
      choice, but any of &rsquo;em would do on a pinch. He was jest blue-mouldy
      for a fight all the while, your grandfather was. He was Benjamin Franklin
      Lawton, the same as me, but somehow I never took much to rassling round or
      fighting. It&rsquo;s more in my line to take things easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda bore an armful of dishes out into the kitchen, without making any
      reply, and Ben, presently wearying of solitude, followed to where she bent
      over the sink, enveloped in soap-suds and steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve got an idea what she&rsquo;s gone for?&rdquo; he propounded, with
      caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a &lsquo;<i>who</i>&rsquo; she&rsquo;s gone for,&rdquo; said Lucinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pronouns were not Ben&rsquo;s strong point, and he said, &ldquo;Yes, I suppose it is,&rdquo;
       rather helplessly. He waited in patience for more information, and by and
      by it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was her, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Lucinda, slapping a plate
      impatiently with the wet cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose you would. In some ways you always had more sense
      than people give you credit for, &lsquo;Cindy,&rdquo; remarked the father, with
      guarded flattery. &ldquo;Jess, now, she&rsquo;s one of your hoity-toity kind&mdash;flare
      up and whirl around like a wheel on a tree in the Fourth of July
      fireworks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s head and shoulders above all the other Lawtons there ever was or
      ever will be, and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo; declared the loyal Lucinda, with
      fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say always,&rdquo; assented Ben. &ldquo;Only&mdash;I thought you said
      you didn&rsquo;t think she was quite right in doing what she&rsquo;s going to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right enough; only she was happy here, and this&rsquo;ll make her
      miserable again&mdash;though, of course, she was always letting her mind
      run on it, and perhaps she&rsquo;ll enjoy having it with her&mdash;only the
      girls may talk&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda let her sentence die off unfinished in a rattle of knives and
      spoons in the dish-pan. Her mind was sorely perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cindy,&rdquo; said Ben, in the frankness of despair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dot-rotted if I
      know what you are talking about.&rdquo; He grew pathetic as he went on: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      your father and I&rsquo;m her father, and there ain&rsquo;t neither of you got a
      better friend on earth than I be; but you never tell me anything, any
      more&rsquo;n as if I was a last year&rsquo;s bird&rsquo;s-nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda&rsquo;s reserve yielded to this appeal. &ldquo;Well, dad,&rdquo; she said, with
      unwonted graciousness of tone, &ldquo;Jess has gone to Tecumseh to bring back&mdash;to
      bring her little boy. She hasn&rsquo;t told me so, but I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father nodded his head in comprehension, and said nothing. He had
      vaguely known of the existence of the child, and he saw more or less
      clearly the reason for this present step. The shame and sorrow which were
      fastened upon his family through this grandson whom he had never seen, and
      never spoken of above a whisper, seemed to rankle in his heart with a new
      pain of mingled bitterness and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mechanically took out his pipe, filled it from loose tobacco in his
      pocket, and struck a match to light it. Then he recalled that the absent
      daughter! objected to his smoking in the house, on account of the wares in
      her shop, and let the flame burn itself out in the coal-scuttle. A
      whimsical query as to whether this calamitous boy had also been named
      Benjamin Franklin crossed his confused mind, and then it perversely raised
      the question whether the child, if so named, would be a &ldquo;hustler&rdquo; or not.
      Ben leaned heavily against the door-sill, and surrendered himself to
      humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he heard Lucinda saying after a time, &ldquo;is why
      she took this spurt all of a sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on account of that Gawd-damned Hod Boyce!&rdquo; groaned Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you told her something about him. What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that they all say that he&rsquo;s going to marry that big Minster girl&mdash;the
      black-eyed one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda turned away from the sink, threw down her dish-cloth with a thud,
      and put her arms akimbo and her shoulders well back. Watching her, Ben
      felt that somehow this girl, too, took after her grandfather rather than
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>is</i> he!&rdquo; she said, her voice high-pitched and vehement. &ldquo;I
      guess <i>we&rsquo;ll</i> have something to say about <i>that</i>!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;A VISITATION OF ANGELS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>EUBEN Tracy waited
      in his office next day for the visit of the milliner, but, to tell the
      truth, devoted very little thought to wondering about her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole summer and autumn, as he sat now and smoked in meditation upon
      them, seemed to have been an utterly wasted period in his life. He had
      done nothing worth recalling. His mind had not even evolved good ideas.
      Through all the interval which lay between this November day and that
      afternoon in March, when he had been for the only time inside the Minster
      house, one solitary set thought had possessed his mind. Long ago it had
      formulated itself in his brain; found its way to the silent, spiritual
      tongue with which we speak to ourselves. He loved Kate Minster, and had
      had room for no other feeling all these months.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, when this thought was still new to him, he had hugged it to his
      heart with delight. Now the melancholy days indeed were come, and he had
      only suffering and disquiet from it. She had never even answered his
      letter proffering assistance. She was as far away from him, as coldly
      unattainable, as the north star. It made him wretched to muse upon her
      beauty and charm; his heart was weary with hopeless longing for her
      friendship&mdash;yet he was powerless to command either mind or heart.
      They clung to her with painful persistency; they kept her image before
      him, whispered her name in his ear, filled all his dreams with her fair
      presence, to make each wakening a fresh grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his revolt against this weakness, Reuben had burned the little scented
      note for which so reverential a treasure-box had been made in his desk.
      But this was of no avail. He could never enter that small inner room where
      he now sat without glancing at the drawer which had once been consecrated
      to the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was humiliating that he should prove to have so little sense and
      strength. He bit his cigar fiercely with annoyance when this aspect of the
      case rose before him. If love meant anything, it meant a mutual sentiment.
      By all the lights of philosophy, it was not possible to love a person who
      did not return that love. This he said to himself over and over again, but
      the argument was not helpful. Still his mind remained perversely full of
      Kate Minster.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time he had taken no step to probe the business which had
      formed the topic of that single disagreeable talk with his partner in the
      preceding March. Miss Minster&rsquo;s failure to answer his letter had deeply
      wounded his pride, and had put it out of the question that he should seem
      to meddle in her affairs. He had never mentioned the subject again to
      Horace. The two young men had gone through the summer and autumn under the
      same office roof, engaged very often upon the same business, but with
      mutual formality and personal reserve. No controversy had arisen between
      them, but Reuben was conscious now that they had ceased to be friends, as
      men understand the term, for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his own part, his dislike for his partner had grown so deep and strong
      that he felt doubly bound to guard himself against showing it. It was
      apparent to the most superficial introspection that a good deal of his
      aversion to Horace arose from the fact that he was on friendly terms with
      the Minsters, and could see Miss Kate every day. He never looked at his
      partner without remembering this, and extracting unhappiness from the
      thought. But he realized that this was all the more reason why he should
      not yield to his feelings. Both his pride and his sense of fairness
      restrained him from quarrelling with Horace on grounds of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the events of the last day or two had opened afresh the former dilemma
      about a rupture over the Minster works business. Since Schuyler Tenney had
      blossomed forth as the visible head of the rolling-mills, Reuben had, in
      spite of his pique and of his resolution not to be betrayed into meddling,
      kept a close watch upon events connected with the two great iron
      manufacturing establishments. He had practically learned next to nothing,
      but he was none the less convinced that a swindle underlay what was going
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with this same conviction that he now strove to understand the
      shutting-down of the furnaces and ore-fields owned by the Minsters, and
      the threatened lockout in the Thessaly Manufacturing Company&rsquo;s mills. But
      it was very difficult to see where dishonesty could come in. The furnaces
      and ore-supply had been stopped by an order of the pig-iron trust, but of
      course the owners would be amply compensated for that. The other company&rsquo;s
      resolve to reduce wages meant, equally of course, a desire to make up on
      the pay-list the loss entailed by the closing of the furnaces, which
      compelled it to secure its raw material elsewhere. Taken by themselves,
      each transaction was intelligible. But considered together, and as both
      advised by the same men, they seemed strangely in conflict. What possible
      reason could the Thessaly Company, for example, have for urging Mrs.
      Minster to enter a trust, the chief purpose of which was to raise the
      price of pig-iron which they themselves bought almost entirely? The
      problem puzzled Reuben. He racked his brain in futile search for the
      missing clew to this financial paradox. Evidently there was such a clew
      somewhere; an initial fact which would explain the whole mystery, if only
      it could be got at. He had for his own satisfaction collected some figures
      about the Minster business, partly exact, partly estimated, and he had
      worked laboriously over these in the effort to discover the false quantity
      which he felt sure was somewhere concealed. But thus far his work had been
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now a strange idea for the moment fascinated his inclination. It was
      nothing else than the thought of putting his pride in his pocket&mdash;of
      going to Miss Minster and saying frankly: &ldquo;I believe you are being robbed.
      In Heaven&rsquo;s name, give me a chance to find out, and to protect you if I am
      right! I shall ask no reward. I shall not even ask ever to see you again,
      once the rescue is achieved. But oh! do not send me away until then&mdash;I
      pray you that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the wild project urged itself upon his mind the man himself seemed
      able to stand apart and watch this battle of his own thoughts and
      longings, like an outside observer. He realized that the passion he had
      nursed so long in silence had affected his mental balance. He was
      conscious of surprise, almost of a hysterical kind of amusement, that
      Reuben Tracy should be so altered as to think twice about such a
      proceeding. Then he fell to deploring and angrily reviling the change that
      had come over him; and lo! all at once he found himself strangely glad of
      the change, and was stretching forth his arms in a fantasy of yearning
      toward a dream figure in creamy-white robes, girdled with a silken cord,
      and was crying out in his soul, &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vision faded away in an instant as there came the sound of rapping at
      the outer door. Reuben rose to his feet, his brain still bewildered by the
      sun-like brilliancy of the picture which had been burned into it, and
      confusedly collected his thoughts as he walked across the larger room. His
      partner had been out of town some days, and he had sent the office-boy
      home, in order that the Lawton girl might be able to talk in freedom. The
      knocking; was that of a woman&rsquo;s hand. Evidently it was Jessica, who had
      come an hour or so earlier than she had appointed. He wondered vaguely
      what her errand might be, as he opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dingy hallway stood two figures instead of one, both thickly clad
      and half veiled. The waning light of late afternoon did not enable him to
      recognize his visitors with any certainty. The smaller lady of the two
      might be Jessica&mdash;the the who stood farthest away. He had almost
      resolved that it was, in this moment of mental dubiety, when the other,
      putting out her gloved hand, said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you don&rsquo;t remember me, it is so long since we met. This is my
      sister, Mr. Tracy&mdash;Miss Ethel Minster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door-knob creaked in Reuben&rsquo;s hand as he pressed upon it for support,
      and there were eccentric flashes of light before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am <i>so</i> glad!&rdquo; was what he said. &ldquo;Do come in&mdash;do come
      in.&rdquo; He led the way into the office with a dazed sense of heading a
      triumphal procession, and then stopped in the centre of the room, suddenly
      remembering that he had not shaken hands. Was it too late now? To give
      himself time to think, he lighted the gas in both offices and closed all
      the shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am <i>so</i> glad!&rdquo; he repeated, as he turned to the two ladies.
      The radiant smile on his face bore out his words. &ldquo;I am afraid the little
      room&mdash;my own place&mdash;is full of cigar-smoke. Let me see about the
      fire here.&rdquo; He shook the grate vehemently, and poked down the coals
      through one of the upper windows. &ldquo;Perhaps it will be warm enough here.
      Let me bring some chairs.&rdquo; He bustled into the inner room, and pushed out
      his own revolving desk-chair, and drew up two others from different ends
      of the office. The easiest chair of all, which was at Horace&rsquo;s table, he
      did not touch. Then, when his two visitors had taken seats, he beamed down
      upon them once more, and said for the third time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really <i>am</i> delighted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kate put up her short veil with a frank gesture. The unaffected
      pleasure which shone in Reuben&rsquo;s face and radiated from his manner was
      something more exuberant than she had expected, but it was grateful to
      her, and she and her sister both smiled in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an apology to make first of all, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; she said, and her
      voice was the music of the seraphim to his senses. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;I
      am afraid I never answered your kind letter last spring. It is a bad habit
      of mine; I am the worst correspondent in the world. And then we went away
      so soon afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg that you won&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said Reuben; and indeed it seemed to
      him to be a trivial thing now&mdash;not worth a thought, much less a word.
      He had taken a chair also, and was at once intoxicated with the rapture of
      looking Kate in the face thus again, and nervous lest the room was not
      warm enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you loosen your wraps?&rdquo; he asked, with solicitude. &ldquo;I am afraid you
      won&rsquo;t feel them when you go out.&rdquo; It was an old formula which he had heard
      his mother use with callers at the farm, but which he himself had never
      uttered before in his life. But then he had never before been pervaded
      with such a tender anxiety for the small comforts of visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kate opened the throat of her fur coat. &ldquo;We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;We must be home to dinner.&rdquo; She paused for a moment and then asked:
      &ldquo;Is there any likelihood of our seeing your partner, Mr. Boyce, here
      to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben&rsquo;s face fell on the instant. Alas, poor fool, he thought, to imagine
      there were angels&rsquo; visits for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, gloomily. &ldquo;I am afraid not. He is out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we didn&rsquo;t want to see him,&rdquo; put in Miss Ethel. &ldquo;Quite the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben&rsquo;s countenance recovered all its luminous radiance. He stole a
      glance at this younger girl&rsquo;s face, and felt that he almost loved her too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miss Kate went on, &ldquo;in fact, we took the opportunity of his being
      away to come and try to see you alone. We are dreadfully anxious, Mr.
      Tracy, about the way things are going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer could not restrain a comprehending nod of the head, but he did
      not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not understand at all what is being done,&rdquo; proceeded Kate. &ldquo;There
      is nobody to explain things to us except the men who are doing those
      things, and it seems to us that they tell us just what they like. We maybe
      doing them an injustice, but we are very nervous about a good many
      matters. That is why we came to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben bowed again. There was an instant&rsquo;s pause, and then he opened one
      of the little mica doors in the stove. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this isn&rsquo;t going to
      burn up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind smoke, the other room is much
      warmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he had safely bestowed his precious visitors in the
      cosier room, and persuaded them to loosen all their furs, that his mind
      was really at ease. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he remarked, with a smile of relief, &ldquo;now go
      ahead. Tell me everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have this difficulty,&rdquo; said Kate, hesitatingly; &ldquo;when I spoke to you
      before, you felt that you couldn&rsquo;t act in the matter, or learn things, or
      advise us, on account of the partnership. And as that still exists&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo;
       She broke off with an inquiring sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Minster,&rdquo; Reuben answered, in a voice so firm and full of
      force that it bore away in front of it all possibility of suspecting that
      he was too bold, &ldquo;when I left you I wanted to tell you, when I wrote to
      you I tried to have you understand, that if there arose a question of
      honestly helping you, of protecting you, and the partnership stood between
      me and that act of honorable service, I would crush the partnership like
      an eggshell, and put all my powers at your disposal. But I am afraid you
      did not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two girls looked at each other, and then at the strong face before
      them, with the focussed light of the argand burner upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;I am afraid we didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I say to you now,&rdquo; pursued Reuben, with a sense of exultation in
      the resolute words as they sounded on his ear, &ldquo;I will not allow any
      professional chimeras to bind me to inactivity, to acquiescence, if a
      wrong is being done to you. And more, I will do all that lies in my power
      to help you understand the whole situation. And if, when it is all mapped
      out before us, you need my assistance to set crooked things straight, why,
      with all my heart you shall have it, and the partnership shall go out of
      the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had said that at the beginning,&rdquo; sighed Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then I did not know what I know now!&rdquo; answered Reuben, holding her
      eyes with his, while the light on his face grew ruddier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, this is what I can tell you,&rdquo; said the elder girl, &ldquo;and I am
      to tell it to you as our lawyer, am I not&mdash;our lawyer in the sense
      that Mr. Boyce is mamma&rsquo;s lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben bowed, and settled himself in his chair to listen. It was a long
      recital, broken now by suggestions from Ethel, now by questions from the
      lawyer. From time to time he made notes on the blotter before him, and
      when the narrative was finished he spent some moments in consulting these,
      and combining them with figures from another paper, in new columns. Then
      he said, speaking slowly and with deliberation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This I take to be the situation: You are millionnaires, and are in a
      strait for money. When I say &lsquo;you&rsquo; I speak of your mother and yourselves
      as one. Your income, which formerly gave you a surplus of sixty thousand
      or seventy thousand dollars a year for new investments, is all at once not
      large enough to pay the interest on your debts, let alone your household
      and personal expenses. First, what has become of this income? It came from
      three sources&mdash;the furnaces, the telegraph stock, and a group of
      minor properties. These furnaces and iron-mines, which were all your own
      until you were persuaded to put a mortgage on them, have been closed by
      the orders of outsiders with whom you were persuaded to combine. Exit your
      income from <i>that</i> source. Telegraph competition has cut down your
      earnings from the Northern Union stock to next to nothing. No doubt we
      shall find that your income from the other properties has been absorbed in
      salaries voted to themselves by the men into whose hands you have fallen.
      That is a very old trick, and I shall be surprised if it does not turn up
      here. In the second place, you are heavily in debt. On the 1st of January
      next, you must borrow money, apparently, to pay the interest on this debt.
      What makes it the harder is that you have not, as far as I can discover,
      had any value received whatever for this debt. In other words, you are
      being swindled out of something like one hundred thousand dollars per
      year, and not even such a property as your father left can stand <i>that</i>
      very long. I should say it was high time you came to somebody for advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before this terribly lucid statement the two girls sat aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Ethel who first found something to say. &ldquo;We never dreamed of this,
      Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; she said, breathlessly. &ldquo;Our idea in coming, what we thought
      of most, was the poor people being thrown out of work in the winter, like
      this, and it being in some way, <i>our</i> fault!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People <i>think</i> it is our fault,&rdquo; interposed Kate. &ldquo;Only to-day, as
      we were driving here, there were some men standing on the corner, and one
      of them called out a very cruel thing about us, as if we had personally
      injured him. But what you tell me&mdash;is it really as bad as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is quite as bad as I have pictured it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is to be done? There must be some way to stop it,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will put these men in prison the first thing, won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Tracy?&rdquo;
       asked Ethel. &ldquo;And oh, I forgot! Who are the men who are robbing us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben smiled gravely, and ignored the latter question. &ldquo;There are a good
      many first things to do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must think it all over very
      carefully before any step is taken. But the very beginning will be, I
      think, for you both to revoke the power of attorney your mother holds for
      you, and to obtain a statement of her management of the trusteeship over
      your property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will refuse it plump! You don&rsquo;t know mamma,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t refuse if the demand were made regularly, could she, Mr.
      Tracy?&rdquo; asked Kate. He shook his head, and she went on: &ldquo;But it seems
      dreadful not to act <i>with</i> mamma in the matter. Just think what a
      situation it will be, to bring our lawyer up to fight her lawyer! It
      sounds unnatural, doesn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t you think, Mr. Tracy, if you were to
      speak to her now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that could hardly be, unless she asked me,&rdquo; returned the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, if I told her all you said, or you wrote it out for me to
      show her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor that either,&rdquo; said Reuben. &ldquo;To speak frankly, Miss Minster, your
      mother is perhaps the most difficult and dangerous element in the whole
      problem. I hope you won&rsquo;t be offended&mdash;but that any woman in her
      senses could have done what she seems to have done, is almost incredible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mamma!&rdquo; commented Ethel. &ldquo;She never would listen to advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, that is just what she has done,&rdquo; broke in Kate. &ldquo;Mr.
      Tracy, tell me candidly, is it possible that the man who advised her to do
      these things&mdash;or rather the two men, both lawyers, who advised her&mdash;could
      have done so honestly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say it was impossible,&rdquo; answered Reuben, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the two girls exchanged glances, and then Kate, looking at her
      watch, rose to her feet. &ldquo;We are already late, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; she said,
      offering him her hand, and unconsciously allowing him to hold it in his
      own as she went on: &ldquo;We are both deeply indebted to you. We want you&mdash;oh,
      so much!&mdash;to help us. We will do everything you say; we will put
      ourselves completely in your hands, won&rsquo;t we, Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger sister said &ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; and then smiled as she furtively
      glanced up into Kate&rsquo;s face and thence downward to her hand. Kate herself
      with a flush and murmur of confusion withdrew the fingers which the lawyer
      still held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must begin,&rdquo; he said, not striving very hard to conceal the
      delight he had had from that stolen custody of the gloved hand, &ldquo;by
      resolving not to say a word to anybody&mdash;least of all to your mother&mdash;about
      having consulted me. You must realize that we have to deal with criminals&mdash;it
      is a harsh word, I know, but there can be no other&mdash;and that to give
      them warning before our plans are laid would be a folly almost amounting
      to crime itself. If I may, Miss Kate&rdquo;&mdash;there was a little gulp in his
      throat as he safely passed this perilous first use of the familiar name&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will write to you to-morrow, outlining my suggestions in detail, telling
      you what to do, perhaps something of what I am going to do, and naming a
      time&mdash;subject, of course, to your convenience&mdash;when we would
      better meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, after some further words on the same lines, the interview ended.
      Reuben went to the door with them, and would have descended to the street
      to bear them company, but they begged him not to expose himself to the
      cold, and so, with gracious adieus, left him in his office and went down,
      the narrow, unlighted staircase, picking their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the landing, where some faint reflection of the starlight and gas-light
      outside filtered through the musty atmosphere, Kate paused a moment to
      gather the weaker form of her sister protectingly close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you utterly tired out, pet?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s been too
      much for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Only&mdash;yes, I am tired of one thing&mdash;of
      your slowness of perception. Why, child alive, Mr. Tracy has been just
      burning to take up our cause ever since he first saw you. You thought he
      was indifferent, and all the while he was over head and ears in love with
      you! I watched him every moment, and it was written all over his face; and
      you never saw it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answering voice fell with a caressing imitation of reproof upon the
      darkness: &ldquo;You silly puss, you think everybody is in love with me!&rdquo; it
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two young ladies, furred and tippeted, emerged upon the sidewalk,
      stepped into their carriage, and were whirled off homeward under the
      starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds later, two other figures, a woman and a child, also emerged
      from this same stairway, and, there being no coachman in waiting for them,
      started on foot down the street. The woman was Jessica Lawton, and she
      walked wearily with drooping head and shoulders, never once looking at the
      little boy whose hand she held, and who followed her in wondering
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had stood in the stairway, drawn up against the wall to let these
      descending ladies pass. She had heard all they said, and had on the
      instant recognized Kate Minster&rsquo;s voice. For a moment, in this darkness
      suddenly illumined by Ethel&rsquo;s words, she had reflected. Then she, too, had
      turned and come down the stairs again. It seemed best, under these new
      circumstances, not to see Reuben Tracy just now. And as she slowly walked
      home, she almost forgot the existence of the little boy, so deeply was her
      mind engaged with what she had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Reuben, the roseate dreams had all come back. From the drear
      mournfulness of chill November his heart had leaped, by a fairy
      transition, straight into the bowers of June, where birds sang and
      fountains plashed, and beauty and happiness were the only law. It would be
      time enough to-morrow to think about this great struggle with cunning
      scoundrels for the rescue of a princely fortune, which opened before him.
      This evening his mind should dwell upon nothing but thoughts of <i>her!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened that an hour later, when he decided to lock up the
      office and go over to supper, he had never once remembered that the Lawton
      girl&rsquo;s appointment remained unkept.

      CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;OVERWHELMING DISCOMFITURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Horace Boyce
      returned to Thessaly the next morning and drove at once to his father&rsquo;s
      house. There, after a longer and more luxurious bath than usual, he
      breakfasted at his leisure, and then shaved and dressed himself with great
      care. He had brought some new clothes from New York, and as he put them on
      he did not regret the long detour to the metropolis, both in going to and
      coming from Pittsburg, which had been made in order to secure them. The
      frock coat was peculiarly to his liking. No noble dandy in all the West
      End of London owed his tailor for a more perfectly fitting garment. It was
      not easy to decide as to the neckwear which should best set off the
      admirable upper lines of this coat, but at last he settled on a
      lustreless, fine-ribbed tie of white silk, into which he set a beautiful
      moonstone pin that Miss Kate had once praised. Decidedly, the <i>ensemble</i>
      left nothing to be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace, having completely satisfied himself, took off the coat again, went
      down-stairs in his velveteen lounging-jacket, and sought out his father in
      the library, which served as a smoking-room for the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General sat in one chair, with his feet comfortably disposed on
      another, and with a cup of coffee on still a third at his side. He was
      reading that morning&rsquo;s Thessaly <i>Banner</i>, through passing clouds of
      cigar-smoke. His brow was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, you&rsquo;re back, are you?&rdquo; was his greeting to his son. &ldquo;I see the
      whole crowd of workmen in your rolling-mills decided last night not to
      submit to the new scale; unanimous, the paper says. Seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I guessed they would,&rdquo; said Horace, nonchalantly. &ldquo;They can all
      be damned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General turned over his paper. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an editorial,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;taking the workmen&rsquo;s side, out and out. Says there&rsquo;s something very
      mysterious about the whole business. Winds up with a hint that steps will
      be taken to test the legality of the trust, and probe the conspiracy that
      underlies it. Those are the words&mdash;&lsquo;probe the conspiracy.&rsquo; Evidently,
      you&rsquo;re going to have John Fairchild in your wool. He&rsquo;s a good fighter,
      once you get him stirred up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can be damned, too,&rdquo; said Horace, taking a chair and lighting a cigar.
      &ldquo;These free-trade editors make a lot of noise, but they don&rsquo;t do anything
      else. They&rsquo;re merely blue-bottle flies on a window-pane&mdash;a deuce of a
      nuisance to nervous people, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m not nervous, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General smiled with good-humored sarcasm at his offspring. &ldquo;Seems to
      me it wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that you were tarred with the same brush
      yourself,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most fellows are free-traders until it touches their own pockets, or
      rather until they get something in their pockets to be touched. Then they
      learn sense,&rdquo; replied Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can count them by thousands,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;But what of the
      other poor devils&mdash;the millions of consumers who pay through the
      nose, in order to keep those pockets full, eh? They never seem to learn
      sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace smiled a little, and then stretched out his limbs in a
      comprehensive yawn. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep on the cars as well as I used to,&rdquo; he
      said, in explanation. &ldquo;I almost wish now I&rsquo;d gone to bed when I got home.
      I don&rsquo;t want to be sleepy <i>this</i> afternoon, of all times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General had returned to his paper. &ldquo;I see there&rsquo;s a story afloat that
      you chaps mean to bring in French Canadian workmen, when the other fellows
      are locked out. I thought there was a contract labor law against that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace yawned again, and then, rising, poured out a little glassful of
      spirits from a bottle on the mantel, and tossed it off. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy enough to get around that. Wendover is up to all those dodges.
      Besides, I think they are already domiciled in Massachusetts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vane&rdquo; Boyce laid down the paper and took off his eye-glasses. &ldquo;I hope
      these fellows haven&rsquo;t got you into a scrape,&rdquo; he remarked, eyeing his son.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t more than half like this whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; was Horace&rsquo;s easy response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take good care of myself. If it comes to &lsquo;dog eat dog,&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll find
      my teeth are filed down to a point quite as sharp as theirs are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; said the father, doubtfully. &ldquo;But that Tenney&mdash;he&rsquo;s got
      eyes in the back of his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Horace, with a pleasant air of patronage, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a
      mere child compared with Wendover. But I&rsquo;m not afraid of them both. I&rsquo;m
      going to play a card this afternoon that will take the wind out of both
      their sails. When that is done, I&rsquo;ll be in a position to lay down the law
      to them, and read the riot act too, if necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General looked inquiry, and Horace went on: &ldquo;I want you to call for me
      at the office at three, and then we&rsquo;ll go together to the Minsters. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t smoke after luncheon, if I were you. I&rsquo;m not going down until
      afternoon. I&rsquo;ll explain to you what my idea is as we walk out there.
      You&rsquo;ve got some &lsquo;heavy father&rsquo; business to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace lay at his ease for a couple of hours in the big chair his father
      had vacated, and mused upon the splendor of his position. This afternoon
      he was to ask Kate Minster to be his wife, and of the answer he had no
      earthly doubt. His place thus made secure, he had some highly interesting
      things to say to Wendover and Tenney. He had fathomed their plans, he
      thought, and could at the right moment turn them to his advantage. He had
      not paid this latest visit to the iron magnates of Pennsylvania for
      nothing. He saw that Wendover had counted upon their postponing all
      discussion of the compensation to be given the Minsters for the closing of
      their furnaces until after January 1, in order that when that date came,
      and Mrs. Minster had not the money to pay the half-yearly twelve thousand
      dollars interest on the bonds, she would be compelled to borrow still more
      from him, and thus tighten the hold which he and Tenney had on the Minster
      property. It was a pretty scheme, but Horace felt that he could block it.
      For one thing, he was certain that he could induce the outside trust
      directors to pass upon the question of compensation long before January.
      And even if this failed, he could himself raise the money which Mrs.
      Minster would need. This he would do. Then he would turn around and demand
      an accounting from these scoundrels of the four hundred thousand dollars
      employed in buying the machinery rights, and levy upon the plant of the
      Thessaly Manufacturing Company, if necessary, to secure Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s
      interests. It became all very clear to his mind, now he thought it over,
      and he metaphorically snapped his fingers at Wendover and Tenney as he
      went up-stairs and once more carefully dressed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stopped in the hall-way as he came down and enjoyed a
      comprehensive view of himself in the large mirror which was framed by the
      hat-rack. The frock coat and the white effect at the neck were excellent.
      The heavy fur collar of the outer coat only heightened their beauty, and
      the soft, fawn-tinted suède gloves were quite as charming in the contrast
      they afforded under the cuffs of the same costly fur. Horace put his
      glossy hat just a trifle to one side, and was too happy even to curse the
      climate which made rubbers over his patent-leather shoes a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that minute before the looking-glass, in the after-time, as
      the culmination of his upward career. It was the proudest, most perfectly
      contented moment of his adult life.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something I want to say to you before you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben Tracy stood at the door of a small inner office, and looked
      steadily at his partner as he uttered these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little doing in the law in these few dead-and-alive weeks
      between terms, and the exquisitely dressed Horace, having gone through his
      letters and signed some few papers, still with one of his gloves on, had
      decided not to wait for his father, but to call instead at the hardware
      store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in a bit of a hurry just now.&rdquo; he said, drawing on the other glove.
      &ldquo;I may look in again before dinner. Won&rsquo;t it keep till then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very long,&rdquo; answered Reuben. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve concluded that the
      partnership was a mistake. It is open to either of us to terminate it at
      will. I wish you would look around, and let me know as soon as you see
      your way to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To getting out,&rdquo; interposed Horace. In his present mood the idea rather
      pleased him than otherwise. &ldquo;With the greatest pleasure in the world. You
      have not been alone in thinking that the partnership was a mistake, I can
      assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we understand each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be back, say at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say at half-past five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past five be it,&rdquo; said Reuben, turning back again to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace made his way across the muddy high street and found his father, who
      smelt rather more of tobacco than could have been wished, but otherwise
      was in complete readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; remarked the young man, as the two walked briskly along,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given Tracy notice that I&rsquo;m going to leave the firm. I daresay we
      shall separate almost immediately. The business hasn&rsquo;t been by any means
      up to my expectations, and, besides, I have too much already to do for the
      Minster estate, and am by way, now, of having a good deal more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, for all that,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;Tracy is a first-rate,
      honest, straightforward fellow. It always did me good to feel that you
      were with him. To tell you the truth, my boy,&rdquo; he went on after a pause,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m damnably uneasy about your being so thick with Tenney and that gang,
      and separating yourself from Tracy. It has an unsafe look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tracy is a tiresome prig,&rdquo; was Horace&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood him quite
      long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation turned now upon the object of their expedition, and when
      this had been explained to the General, and his part in it outlined, he
      had forgotten his forebodings about his son&rsquo;s future.
    </p>
    <p>
      That son himself, as he strode along, with his head well up and his
      shoulders squared, was physically an object upon which the paternal eye
      could look with entire pride. The General said to himself that he was not
      only the best-dressed, but the handsomest young fellow in all Dearborn
      County; and from this it was but a mental flash to the recollection that
      the Boyces had always been handsome fellows, and the old soldier recalled
      with satisfaction how well he himself had felt that he looked when he rode
      away from Thessaly at the head of his regiment after the firing on Fort
      Sumter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster came down alone to the drawingroom to receive her visitors,
      and showed by her manner some surprise that the General accompanied his
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather wanted to talk with you about what you learned at Pittsburg,&rdquo;
       she said, somewhat bluntly, to Horace, after conversation on ordinary
      topics had begun to flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General rose at this. &ldquo;Pray let me go into the library for a time, I
      beg of you,&rdquo; he said, in his courtly, cheery manner. &ldquo;I know the way, and
      I can amuse myself there till you want me; that is,&rdquo; he added, with a
      twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;if you decide that you want me at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster bowed as the General went off. She did not quite understand
      what this stout, red-faced man meant by being wanted, and she was
      extremely anxious to know all that her lawyer had to tell her about the
      trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had to tell her was eminently satisfactory. The directors had
      postponed the question of how much money should be paid for the
      shutting-down of the Minster furnaces, simply because it was taken for
      granted that so opulent a concern could not be in a hurry about a
      settlement. He was sure that he could have the affair all arranged before
      December. As to other matters, he was equally confident. A year hence she
      would be in vastly better condition, financially, than she had ever been
      before. Under these assurances Mrs. Minster purred visible content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Horace began to introduce the subject nearest his heart. The family
      had been excessively kind to him during the summer, he said. He had been
      privileged to meet them on terms of almost intimacy, both here and
      elsewhere. Every day of this delightful intercourse had but strengthened
      his original desire. True to his word, he had never uttered a syllable of
      what lay on his heart to Miss Kate, but he was not without confidence that
      she looked upon him favorably. They had seemed always the best of friends,
      and she had accepted from him attentions which must have shadowed forth to
      her, at least vaguely, the state of his mind. He had brought his father&mdash;in
      accordance with what he felt to be the courtesy due from one old family to
      another&mdash;to formally speak with her upon the subject, if she desired
      it, and then he himself, if she thought it best, would beg for an
      interview with Miss Kate. Or did Mrs. Minster think it preferable to leave
      this latter to the sweet arbitrament of chance?
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace looked so well in his new clothes, and talked with such fluency of
      feeling, and moreover had brought such comforting intelligence about the
      business troubles, that Mrs. Minster found herself at the end smiling on
      him maternally, and murmuring some sort of acquiescence to his remarks in
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then shall I bring in my father?&rdquo; He asked the question eagerly, and
      rising before she could reply, went swiftly to the door of the hall and
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stopped with abruptness, and held the door open with a hand that
      began to tremble as the color left his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice in the hall was speaking, and with such sharply defined
      distinctness and high volume that each word reached even the mother where
      she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You may tell your son, General Boyce,&rdquo;</i> said this voice, <i>&ldquo;that I
      will not see him. I am sorry to have to say it to you, who have always
      been polite to me, but your son is not a good man or an honest man, and I
      wish never to see him again. With all my heart I wish, too, that we never
      had seen him, any of us.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An indistinct sound of pained remonstrance arose outside as the echoes of
      this first voice died away. Then followed a noise of footsteps ascending
      the carpeted stairs, and Horace&rsquo;s empty, staring eyes had a momentary
      vision of a woman&rsquo;s form passing rapidly upward, away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stood face to face with his father&mdash;a bleared, swollen,
      indignant countenance it was that thrust itself close to his&mdash;and he
      heard his father say, huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going. Let us get out of this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace mechanically started to follow. Then he remembered that he had left
      his hat behind, and went back into the drawing-room where Mrs. Minster
      sat. The absence of deep emotion on her statuesque face momentarily
      restored his own presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard your daughter?&rdquo; he said, his head hanging in spite of
      himself, but his eyes keeping a strenuous scrutiny upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: I don&rsquo;t know what has come over Kate, lately,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
      Minster; &ldquo;she always was the most curious girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious, indeed!&rdquo; He choked down the sneer which tempted him, and went on
      slowly: &ldquo;You heard what she said&mdash;that I was dishonest, wicked. Where
      she has suddenly got this new view of me, doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;at least,
      just at this moment. But I surely ought to ask if you&mdash;if you share
      it. Of course, if I haven&rsquo;t your confidence, why, I must lay down
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy, no! You mustn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; the lady said, with animation.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know in the least what it all means. I never do know
      with my daughters. They get all sorts of crazy notions. It makes my head
      ache sometimes wondering what they will do next&mdash;Kate, especially.
      No, you mustn&rsquo;t mind her. You really mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s manner had gradually taken on firmness, as if under a coat
      of ice. The glance which he still bent upon Mrs. Minster had a novel
      glitter in it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am to remain your lawyer, in spite of this, as if it hadn&rsquo;t
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bless me, yes! Why not? Girls will be girls, I suppose. At least,
      that is the saying. But&mdash;oh, by all means! You must see me through
      this dreadful trust business, though, as you say, it must all be better in
      the end than ever before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, Mrs. Minster. I shall continue, then, to hold myself at your
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with the same grave slowness, and bowed formally, as if to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady rose, and of her own volition offered him her hand. &ldquo;Perhaps
      things will alter in her mind. I am so sorry!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man permitted himself a ghostly half-smile. &ldquo;It is only when I
      have thought it all over that I shall know whether I am sorry or not,&rdquo; he
      said, and bowing again he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out by the gate, standing on the gravel-path wet with November rain and
      strewn with damp, fallen leaves, the General waited for him. The air had
      grown chill, and the sky was spreading a canopy for the night of gloomy
      gray clouds. The two men, without a word, fell into step, and walked down
      the street together. What was there to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace, striding silently along with his teeth tight set, his head bowed
      and full of fierce confusion of thought, and his eyes angrily fixed on the
      nothing straight ahead, became, all at once, aware that his office-boy was
      approaching on the sidewalk, whistling dolefully to suit the weather, and
      carrying his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, Robert?&rdquo; the lawyer demanded, stopping the lad, and
      speaking with the aggressive abruptness of a man longing to affront all
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered the boy, wondering what was up, and
      confusedly taking his hands out of his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; This second question was even more sharply put.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This letter from Mr. Tracy.&rdquo; The boy took a letter from the inside of his
      coat, and then added: &ldquo;I said Mrs. Minster, but the letter is for her
      daughter. I&rsquo;m to give it to her herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take charge of it myself,&rdquo; said Horace, with swift decision,
      stretching out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another hand was reached forth also, and grasped the young man&rsquo;s
      extended wrist with a vehement grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by God! you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; swore the General, his face purpling with the
      rush of angry blood, and his little gray eyes flashing. &ldquo;No, sir, you
      won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he repeated; and then, bending a momentary glance upon the boy, he
      snapped out: &ldquo;Well, you! don&rsquo;t stand staring here! Go and do your errand
      as you were told!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The office-boy started with a run to obey his command, and did not slacken
      his pace until he had turned a corner. He had never encountered a real
      general in action before, and the experience impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father and son looked in silence into each other&rsquo;s faces for an instant.
      Then the father said, with something between a curse and a groan:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! the girl was right! You <i>are</i> a damned scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, however that may be,&rdquo; replied Horace, frowning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the
      mood just now to take any cheek, least of all from you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the General stared at him with swelling rage in his fat face, and
      quivering, inarticulate lips, his son went on in a bitter voice, from
      between clinched teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe this to you! to nobody else but you! Everything I did was done to
      lift you out of the gutter, to try and make a man of you again, to put you
      back into decent society&mdash;to have the name of Boyce something else
      once more besides a butt for bar-keepers and factory-girls. I had you
      around my neck like a mill-stone, and you&rsquo;ve pulled me down. I hope you&rsquo;re
      satisfied!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment it seemed as if the General would fall. His thick neck grew
      scarlet, his eyes turned opaque and filled with tears, and he trembled and
      almost tottered on his legs. Then the fit passed as suddenly as it had
      come. He threw a sweeping glance up and down the figure of his son&mdash;taking
      in the elegant line of the trousers, the costly fur, the delicate,
      spotless gloves, the white jewelled neckwear, the shining hat, the
      hardened and angry face beneath it&mdash;and then broke boisterously forth
      into a loud guffaw of contemptuous laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had laughed his fill, he turned upon his heel without a word and
      walked away, carrying himself with proud erectness, and thumping his
      umbrella on the sidewalk with each step as he went.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;THE LOCKOUT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Thessaly awoke
      one morning some fortnight later, and rubbed its eyes, and, looking again,
      discovered in truth that everything outside was white, the recognition of
      the familiar visitor was followed by a sigh. The children still had a
      noisy friendliness of greeting for the snow, and got out their sleds and
      bored anticipatory holes in their boot-heels with a thrill of old-time
      enthusiasm; but even their delight became subdued in its manifestations
      before noon had arrived&mdash;their elders seemed to take the advent of
      winter so seriously. Villagers, when they spoke to one another that
      morning, noted that the voice of the community had suddenly grown graver
      in tone and lower in pitch. The threat of the approaching season weighed
      with novel heaviness on the general mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since the place had begun its manufacturing career,
      Thessaly was idle. The Minster furnaces had been closed for more than two
      weeks; the mills of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company, for nearly that
      length of time. Half the bread-winners in the town were out of work and
      saw no prospect of present employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage is most of all advantageous <i>in</i> adversity; These artisans of
      Thessaly lacked experience in enforced idleness and the trick of making
      bricks without straw. Employment, regular and well requited, had become so
      much a matter of course that its sudden cessation now bewildered and
      angered them. Each day brought to their minds its fresh train of
      calamitous consequences. Children needed shoes; the flour-barrel was
      nearly empty; to lay in a pig for the winter might now be impossible. The
      question of rent quarter loomed black and menacing like a thunder-cloud on
      the horizon; and there were those with mortgages on their little homes,
      who already saw this cloud streaked with the lightning of impending
      tempest. Anxious housewives began to retrench at the grocer&rsquo;s and
      butcher&rsquo;s; but the saloons and tobacco shops had almost doubled their
      average of receipts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even on ordinary holidays the American workman, bitten as he is with the
      eager habitude of labor, more often than not some time during the day
      finds himself close to the place where at other times he is employed.
      There his thoughts are: thither his steps all unconsciously bend
      themselves. So now, in this melancholy, indefinite holiday which November
      had brought to Thessaly, the idlers instinctively hung about the deserted
      works. The tall, smokeless chimneys, the locked gates, the grimy windows&mdash;through
      which the huge dark forms of the motionless machines showed dimly, like
      the fossils of extinct monsters in a museum&mdash;the dreary stretches of
      cinder heaps and blackened waste which surrounded the silent buildings&mdash;all
      these had a cruel kind of fascination for the dispossessed toilers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came each day and stood lazily about in groups: they smoked in
      taciturnity, told sardonic stories, or discussed their grievance, each
      according to his mood; but they kept their eyes on the furnaces and mills
      whence wages came no more and where all was still. There was something in
      it akin in pathos to the visits a mother pays to the graveyard where her
      child lies hidden from sight under the grass and the flowers. It was the
      tomb of their daily avocation that these men came to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as time went on, there grew to be less and less of the pathetic in
      what these men thought and said. The sense of having been wronged swelled
      within them until there was room for nothing but wrath. In a general way
      they understood that a trust had done this thing to them. But that was too
      vague and far-off an object for specific cursing. The Minster women were
      nearer home, and it was quite clear that they were the beneficiaries of
      the trust&rsquo;s action. There were various stories told about the vast sum
      which these greedy women had been paid by the trust for shutting down
      their furnaces and stopping the output of iron ore from their fields, and
      as days succeeded one another this sum steadily magnified itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thessaly Manufacturing Company, which concerned a much larger number
      of workmen, stood on a somewhat different footing. Mechanics who knew men
      who were friendly with Schuyler Tenney learned in a roundabout fashion
      that he really had been forced into closing the mills by the action of the
      Minster women. When you came to think of it, this seemed very plausible.
      Then the understanding sifted about among the men that the Minsters were,
      in reality, the chief owners of the Manufacturing Company, and that Tenney
      was only a business manager and minor partner, who had been overruled by
      these heartless women. All this did not make friends for Tenney. The
      lounging workmen on the street comers eyed him scowlingly when he went by,
      but their active hatred passed him over and concentrated itself upon the
      widow and daughters of Stephen Minster. On occasion now, when fresh rumors
      of the coming of French Canadian workmen were in the air, very sinister
      things were muttered about these women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the lockout had been two days old, one of the State officers of a
      labor association had visited Thessaly, had addressed a hastily convened
      meeting of the ejected workmen, and had promised liberal assistance from
      the central organization. He had gone away again, but two or three
      subordinate officials of the body had appeared in town and were still
      there. They professed to be preparing detailed information upon which
      their chiefs could act intelligently. They had money in their pockets, and
      displayed a quite metropolitan freedom about spending it over the various
      bars. Some of the more conservative workmen thought these emissaries put
      in altogether too much time at these bars, but they were evidently popular
      with the great bulk of the men. They had a large fund of encouraging
      reminiscence about the way bloated capitalists had been beaten and humbled
      and brought down to their knees elsewhere in the country, and they were
      evidently quite confident that the workers would win this fight, too. Just
      how it was to be won no one mentioned, but when the financial aid began to
      come in it would be time to talk about that. And when the French Canadians
      came, too, it would be time&mdash;The rest of this familiar sentence was
      always left unspoken, but lowering brows and significant nods told how it
      should be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      So completely did this great paralytic stroke to industry monopolize
      attention, that events in the village, not immediately connected with it,
      passed almost unnoticed. Nobody gave a second thought, for example, to the
      dissolution of the law firm of Tracy &amp; Boyce, much less dreamed of
      linking it in any way with the grand industrial drama which engaged public
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace, at the same time, took rooms at the new brick hotel, the Central,
      which had been built near the railroad depot, and opened an office of his
      own a block or two lower down Main Street than the one he had vacated.
      This did not attract any special comment, and when, on the evening of the
      16th of November, a meeting of the Thessaly Citizens&rsquo; Club was convened,
      fully half those who attended learned there for the first time that the
      two young lawyers had separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club at last had secured a building for itself&mdash;or rather the
      refusal of one&mdash;and this meeting was called to decide upon ratifying
      the purchase. It was held in a large upper room of the building under
      discussion, which had been the gymnasium of a German Turn Verein, and
      still had stowed away in its comers some of the apparatus that the
      athletes had used.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Horace, as president, called the gathering to order, there were some
      forty men present, representing very fairly the business and professional
      classes of the village. Schuyler Tenney was there as one of the newer
      members; and Reuben Tracy, with John Fairchild, Dr. Lester, Father Chance,
      and others of the founders, sat near one another farther back in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president, with ready facility, laid before the meeting the business
      at hand. The building they were in could be purchased, or rented on a
      reasonably extended lease. It seemed to the committee better to take it
      than to think of erecting one for themselves&mdash;at least for the
      present. So much money would be needed: so much for furniture, so much for
      repairs, etc.; so much for heating and lighting, so much for service, and
      so on&mdash;a very compact and lucid statement, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half hour was passed in more or less inconclusive discussion before
      Reuben Tracy rose to his feet and began to speak. The story that he and
      Boyce were no longer friends had gone the round of the room, and some men
      turned their chairs to give him the closer attention with eye and ear.
      Before long all were listening with deep interest to every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben started by saying that there was something even more important than
      the question of the new building, and that was the question of what the
      club itself meant. In its inception, the idea of creating machinery for
      municipal improvement had been foremost. Certainly he and those associated
      with him in projecting the original meeting had taken that view of their
      work. That meeting had contented itself with an indefinite expression of
      good intentions, but still had not dissented from the idea that the club
      was to mean something and to do something. Now it became necessary, before
      final steps were taken, to ask what that something was to be. So far as he
      gathered, much thought had been given as to the probable receipts and
      expenditure, as to where the card-room, the billiard-room, the lunch-room,
      and so forth should be located, and as to the adoption of all modern
      facilities for making themselves comfortable in their new club-house. But
      about the original objects of the club he had not heard a syllable. To him
      this attitude was profoundly unsatisfactory. At the present moment, the
      village was laboring under a heavy load of trouble and anxiety. Nearly if
      not quite a thousand families were painfully affected by the abrupt
      stoppage of the two largest works in the section. If actual want was not
      already experienced, at least the vivid threat of it hung over their
      poorer neighbors all about them. This fact, it seemed to him, must appeal
      to them all much more than any conceivable suggestion about furnishing a
      place in which they might sit about at their ease in leisure hours. He put
      it to the citizens before him, that their way was made exceptionally clear
      for them by this calamity which had overtaken their village. If the club
      meant anything, it must mean an organization to help these poor people who
      were suddenly, through no fault of their own, deprived of incomes and
      employment. That was something vital, pressing, urgent; easy-chairs and
      billiard-tables could wait, but the unemployed artisans of Thessaly and
      their families could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      This in substance was what Reuben said; and when he had finished there
      succeeded a curious instant of dead silence, and then a loud confusion of
      comment. Half a dozen men were on their feet now, among them both Tenney
      and John Fairchild.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hardware merchant spoke first, and what he said was not so prudent as
      those who knew him best might have expected. The novel excitement of
      speaking in public got into his head, and he not only used language like a
      more illiterate man than he really was, but he attacked Tracy personally
      for striving to foment trouble between capital and labor, and thereby
      created an unfavorable impression upon the minds of his listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Editor Fairchild had ready a motion that the building be taken on a lease,
      but that a special committee be appointed by the meeting to devise means
      for using it to assist the men of Thessaly now out of employment, and that
      until the present labor crisis was over, all questions of furnishing a
      club-house proper be laid on the table. He spoke vigorously in support of
      this measure, and when he had finished there was a significant round of
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace rose when order had been restored, and speaking with some
      hesitation, said that he would put the motion, and that if it were carried
      he would appoint such a committee, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said &lsquo;to be appointed by the meeting&rsquo;!&rdquo; called out John Fairchild,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president did not finish his sentence, but sat down again, and Tenney
      pushed forward and whispered in his ear. Two or three others gathered
      sympathetically about, and then still others joined the group formed about
      the president, and discussed eagerly in undertones this new situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must decline to put the motion. It does not arise out of the report. It
      is out of order,&rdquo; answered Horace at last, as a result of this faction
      conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will put it myself,&rdquo; cried Fairchild, rising. &ldquo;But I beg first to
      move that you leave the chair!&rdquo; Horace looked with angered uncertainty
      down upon the men who remained seated about Fairchild. They were as thirty
      to his ten, or thereabouts. He could not stand up against this majority.
      For a moment he had a fleeting notion of trying to conciliate it, and
      steer a middle course, but Tenney&rsquo;s presence had made that impossible. He
      laid down his gavel, and, gathering up his hat and coat, stepped off the
      platform to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need of moving that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go without it. So far as
      I am concerned, the meeting is over, and the club doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way out, followed by Tenney, Jones the match-manufacturer, the
      Rev. Dr. Turner, and five or six others. One or two gentlemen rose as if
      to join the procession, and then thinking better of it sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      By general suggestion, John Fairchild took the chair thus vacated, but
      beyond approving the outlines of his plan, and appointing a committee with
      Tracy at its head to see what could be done to carry it out, the meeting
      found very little to do. It was agreed that this committee should also
      consider the question of funds, and should call a meeting when it was
      ready to report, which should be at the earliest possible date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the meeting broke up, and its members dispersed, not without
      well-founded apprehensions that they had heard the last of the Thessaly
      Citizens&rsquo; Club.

      CHAPTER XXVIII.&mdash;IN THE ROBBER&rsquo;S CAVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ORACE Boyce was
      too enraged to preserve a polite demeanor toward the sympathizers who had
      followed him out of the hall, and who showed a disposition to discuss the
      situation with him now the street was reached. After a muttered word or
      two to Tenney, the young man abruptly turned his back on the group, and
      walked with a hurried step down the street toward his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the building, he made his way direct to the bar-room back of the
      office&mdash;a place where he had rarely been before&mdash;and poured out
      for himself a heavy portion of whiskey, which he drank off without
      noticing the glass of iced water placed for him beside the bottle. He
      turned to go, but came back again to the bar after he had reached the
      swinging screen-doors, and said he would take a bottle of the liquor up to
      his room. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been sleeping well these last few nights,&rdquo; he
      explained to the bar-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in his room, Horace put off his boots, got into easy coat and
      slippers, raked down the fire, looked for an aimless minute or two at the
      row of books on his shelf, and then threw himself into the arm-chair
      beside the stove. The earlier suggestion of gray in his hair at the
      temples had grown more marked these last few weeks, and there were new
      lines of care on his clear-cut face, which gave it a haggard look now as
      he bent his brows in rumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important interview with Tenney and Wendover was to take place in this
      room a half hour later; but, besides a certain hard-drawn notion that he
      would briskly hold his own with them, Horace did not try to form plans for
      this or even to fasten his mind upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortnight or more that had passed since that terrible momentary vision
      of Kate Minster running up the stairs to avoid him, had been to the young
      man a period of unexampled gloominess and unrest, full of deep wrath at
      the fate which had played upon him such a group of scurvy tricks all at
      once, yet having room for sustained exasperation over the minor
      discomforts of his new condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarrel with his father had forced him to change his residence, and
      this was a peculiarly annoying circumstance coming at just such a time. He
      realized now that he had been very comfortable in the paternal house, and
      that his was a temperament extremely dependent upon well-ordered and
      satisfactory surroundings. These new rooms of his, though they cost a good
      deal of money, were not at all to his liking, and the service was
      execrable. The sense of being at home was wholly lacking; he felt as
      disconnected and out of touch with the life about him as if he had been
      travelling in a foreign country which he did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great humiliation and wrong&mdash;the fact that he had been rejected
      with open contumely by the rich girl he had planned to marry&mdash;lay
      steadily day and night upon the confines of his consciousness, like a huge
      black morass with danger signals hung upon all its borders. His perverse
      mind kept returning to view these menacing signals, and torturing him with
      threats to disregard them and plunge into the forbidden darkness. The
      constant strain to hold his thoughts back from this hateful abyss wore
      upon him like an unremitting physical pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolve which had chilled and stiffened him into self-possession that
      afternoon in the drawingroom, and had even enabled him to speak with cold
      distinctness to Mrs. Minster and to leave the house of insult and defeat
      with dignity, had been as formless and unshaped as poor, heart-torn,
      trembling Lear&rsquo;s threat to his daughters before Gloster&rsquo;s gate. Revenge he
      would have&mdash;sweeping, complete, merciless, but by what means he knew
      not. That would come later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks were gone, and the revenge seemed measurably nearer, though
      still its paths were all unmapped. It was clear enough to the young man&rsquo;s
      mind now that Tenney and Wendover were intent on nothing less than
      plundering the whole Minster estate. Until that fatal afternoon in the
      drawingroom, he had kept himself surrounded with an elaborate system of
      self-deception. He had pretended to himself that the designs of these
      associates of his were merely smart commercial plans, which needed only to
      be watched with equal smartness. Now the pretence was put aside. He knew
      the men to be villains, and openly rated them as such in his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a stem satisfaction in the thought that their schemes were in his
      hands. He would join them now, frankly and with all his heart, only
      providing the condition that his share of the proceeds should be
      safe-guarded. They should have his help to wreck this insolent,
      purse-proud, newly rich family, to strip them remorselessly of their
      wealth. His fellow brigands might keep the furnaces, might keep everything
      in and about this stupid Thessaly. He would take his share in hard coin,
      and shake the mud and slush of Dearborn County from off his feet. He was
      only in the prime of his youth. Romance beckoned to him from a hundred
      centres of summer civilization, where men knew how to live, and girls
      added culture and dowries to beauty and artistic dress. Oh, yes! he would
      take his money and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dream of a career in his native village had brought him delight only
      so long as Kate Minster was its central figure. That vision now seemed so
      clumsy and foolish that he laughed at it. He realized that he had never
      liked the people here about him. Even the Minsters had been provincial,
      only a gilded variation upon the rustic character of the section. Nothing
      but the over-sanguine folly of youth could ever have prompted him to think
      that he wanted to be mayor of Thessaly, or that it would be good to link
      his fortunes with the dull, under-bred place. Oh, no! he would take his
      money and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men for whom he had been waiting broke abruptly in upon his revery
      by entering the room. They came in without even a show of knocking on the
      door, and Horace frowned a little at their rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stout Judge Wendover panted heavily with the exertion of ascending the
      stairs, and it seemed to have put him out of temper as well as breath. He
      threw off his overcoat with an impatient jerk, took a chair, and gruffly
      grunted &ldquo;How-de-do!&rdquo; in the direction of his host, without taking the
      trouble to even nod a salutation. Tenney also seated himself, but he did
      not remove his overcoat. Even in the coldest seasons he seemed to wear the
      same light, autumnal clothes, creaseless and gray, and mouselike in
      effect. The two men looked silently at Horace, and he felt that they
      disapproved his velveteen coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked, at last, leaning back in his chair and trying to equal
      them in indifference. &ldquo;What is new in New York, Judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind New York! Thessaly is more in our line just now,&rdquo; said
      Wendover, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man simulated a slight yawn. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to my share of the
      town, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very enthusiastic about it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much has Reuben Tracy got to work on? How much have you blabbed about
      our business to him?&rdquo; asked the New Yorker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neither know nor care anything about Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; said Horace, coldly.
      &ldquo;As for what you elegantly describe as my &lsquo;blabbing&rsquo; to him, I daresay you
      understand what it means. I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that you have made a fool of us; got us into trouble; perhaps
      ruined the whole business, by your God A&rsquo;mighty stupidity! That&rsquo;s what it
      means!&rdquo; said Wendover, with his little blue-bead eyes snapping angrily in
      the lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t strike you as irrelevant if I suggest that this is my
      room,&rdquo; drawled Horace, &ldquo;and that I have a distinct preference for civil
      conversation in it. If you have any criticisms to offer upon my conduct,
      as you seem to think that you have, I must beg that you couch them in the
      language which gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen be damned!&rdquo; broke in the Judge, sharply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had too much
      &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo; in this whole business! Answer me a plain question. What does
      Tracy mean by his applications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the remotest idea what you are talking about. I&rsquo;ve already told
      you that I know nothing of Mr. Tracy or his doings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schuyler Tenney interposed, impassively: &ldquo;He may not have heard of the
      application, Judge. You must remember that, for the sake of appearances,
      he then being in partnership, you were made Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s attorney, in
      both the agreements. That is how notices came to be served on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge had not taken his eyes off the young man in the velveteen
      jacket. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you haven&rsquo;t learned from Mrs. Minster
      that this man Tracy has made applications on behalf of the daughters to
      upset the trust agreement, and to have a receiver appointed to overhaul
      the books of the Mfg. Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace sat up straight. &ldquo;Good God, no!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard nothing
      of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never do seem to hear about things. What did you suppose you were
      here for, except to watch Mrs. Minster, and keep track of what was going
      on?&rdquo; demanded Wendover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may tell you,&rdquo; answered Horace, speaking hesitatingly, &ldquo;that
      circumstances have arisen which render it somewhat difficult for me to
      call upon Mrs. Minster at her house&mdash;for that matter, out of the
      question. She has only been to my office office within the&mdash;the last
      fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schuyler Tenney spoke again. &ldquo;The &lsquo;circumstances&rsquo; means, Judge, that he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Tenney,&rdquo; said Horace, with decision: &ldquo;what the
      circumstances mean is neither your business nor that of your friend. That
      is something that we will not discuss, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we, though!&rdquo; burst in Wendover, peremptorily. &ldquo;You make a fool of
      us. You go sneaking around one of the girls up there. You think you&rsquo;ll set
      yourself in a tub of butter, and let our schemes go to the devil. You try
      to play this behind our backs. You get kicked out of the house for your
      impudence. And then you sit here, dressed like an Italian organ-grinder,
      by God, and tell me that we won&rsquo;t discuss the subject!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace rose to his feet, with all his veins tingling. &ldquo;You may leave this
      room, both of you,&rdquo; he said, in a voice which he with difficulty kept
      down. His face was pale with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Wendover rose, also, but it was not to obey Horace&rsquo;s command.
      Instead, he pointed imperiously to the chair which the young man had
      vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down there,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Sit down, I tell you! I warn you, I&rsquo;m in no
      mood to be fooled with. You deserve to have your neck wrung for what
      you&rsquo;ve done already. If I have another word of cheek from you, by God, it
      <i>shall</i> be wrung! We&rsquo;ll throw you on the dungheap as we would a dead
      rat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace had begun to listen to these staccato sentences with his arms
      folded, and lofty defiance in his glance. Somehow, as he looked into his
      antagonist&rsquo;s blazing eyes, his courage melted before their hot menace. The
      pudgy figure of the Judge visibly magnified itself under his gaze, and the
      threat in that dry, husky voice set his nerves to quaking. He sank into
      his seat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, in an altered voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing enough to talk,
      only a man doesn&rsquo;t like to be bullied in that way in his own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tarnation sight better than being bullied by a warder in Auburn
      State&rsquo;s prison,&rdquo; said the Judge, as he too resumed his chair. &ldquo;Take my
      word for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schuyler Tenney crossed his legs nervously at this, and coughed. Horace
      looked at them both in a mystified but uneasy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard what I said?&rdquo; queried Wendover, brusquely, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly I did,&rdquo; answered Horace. &ldquo;But&mdash;but its application
      escaped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I mean is&rdquo;&mdash;the Judge hesitated for a moment to note Tenney&rsquo;s
      mute signal of dissuasion, and then went on: &ldquo;We might as well not beat
      about the bush&mdash;what I mean is that there&rsquo;s a penitentiary job in
      this thing for somebody, unless we all keep our heads, and have good luck
      to boot. You&rsquo;ve done your best to get us all into a hole, with your
      confounded airs and general foolishness. If worse comes to worst, perhaps
      we can save ourselves, but there won&rsquo;t be a ghost of a chance for you.
      I&rsquo;ll see to that myself. If we come to grief, you shall pay for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Horace, in a subdued tone, after a period of
      silent reflection. &ldquo;Where does the penitentiary part come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with the Judge at all,&rdquo; interposed Tenney, eagerly. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any need of looking on the dark side of the thing. We
      don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> that Tracy knows anything. And then, why shouldn&rsquo;t we be
      able to get our own man appointed receiver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the situation,&rdquo; said Wendover, speaking deliberately. &ldquo;You
      advised Mrs. Minster to borrow four hundred thousand dollars for the
      purchase of certain machinery patents, and you drew up the papers for the
      operation. It happens that she already owned&mdash;or rather that the Mfg.
      Company already owned&mdash;these identical rights and patents. They were
      a part of the plant and business we put into the company at one hundred
      and fifty thousand dollars when we moved over from Cadmus. But nobody on
      her side, except old Clarke, knew just what it was that we put in. He died
      in Florida, and it was arranged that his papers should pass to you. There
      was no record that we had sold the right of the nail machine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace gazed with bewilderment into the hard-drawn, serious faces of the
      two men who sat across the little table from him. In the yellow lamplight
      these countenances looked like masks, and he searched them in vain for any
      sign of astonishment or emotion. The thing which was now for the first
      time being put into words was strange, but as it shaped itself in his mind
      he did not find himself startled. It was as if he had always known about
      it, but had allowed it to lapse in his memory. These men were thieves&mdash;and
      he was their associate! The room with its central point of light where the
      three knaves were gathered, and its deepening shadows round about,
      suggested vaguely to him a robber&rsquo;s cave. Primary instincts arose strong
      within him. Terror lest discovery should come yielded precedence to a
      fierce resolve to have a share of the booty. It seemed minutes to him
      before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she was persuaded to mortgage her property, to buy over again at
      four times its value what she had already purchased?&rdquo; he asked, with an
      assumption of calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to be about what you managed to induce her to do,&rdquo; said the
      Judge, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you admit that it was I who did it&mdash;that you owe the success of
      the thing to me!&rdquo; The young man could not restrain his eagerness to
      establish this point. He leaned over the table, and his eyes sparkled with
      premature triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: I said &lsquo;<i>seems</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered Wendover. &ldquo;<i>We</i> know better. <i>We</i>
      know that from the start you have done nothing but swell around at our
      expense, and create as many difficulties for us and our business as
      possible. But the courts and the newspapers would look at it differently.
      <i>They</i> would be sure to regard you as the one chiefly responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think we were pretty much in the same boat, my friend,&rdquo; said
      Horace, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; replied the New Yorker, &ldquo;only with this difference: we can
      swim, and you can&rsquo;t. By that I mean, we&rsquo;ve got money, and you haven&rsquo;t. See
      the point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace saw the point, and felt himself revolted at the naked selfishness
      and brutality with which it was exposed. The disheartening fact that these
      men would not hesitate for an instant to sacrifice him&mdash;that they did
      not like him, and would not lift a finger to help him unless it was
      necessary for their own salvation&mdash;rose gloomily before his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, it would be better for all of us that the boat shouldn&rsquo;t be
      capsized at all,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the point,&rdquo; put in Tenney, with animation; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      what I said to the Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Tracy of yours,&rdquo; said Wendover, &ldquo;has got hold of the Minster girls.
      He&rsquo;s acting for them. He has been before Judge Waller with a whole batch
      of applications. First, in chambers, he&rsquo;s brought an action to dissolve
      the trust, and asked for an order returnable at Supreme Court chambers to
      show cause why, in the mean time, the furnaces shouldn&rsquo;t be opened. His
      grounds are, first, that the woman was deceived; and second, that the
      trust is against public policy. Now, it seems to me that our State courts
      can&rsquo;t issue an order binding on a board of directors at Pittsburg. Isn&rsquo;t
      it a thing that belongs to a United States court? How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Horace. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new question to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tenney told me you knew something as a lawyer,&rdquo; was Wendover&rsquo;s angry
      comment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where it comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hardware merchant hastened to avert the threatened return to
      personalities. &ldquo;Tell him about the receiver motion,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Tracy, before the same judge, but in special term, has applied for a
      receiver for the Thessaly Mfg. Company, on the ground of fraud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the meanest thing about the whole business,&rdquo; commented Tenney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you advise doing?&rdquo; asked Horace, despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two things,&rdquo; said Wendover. &ldquo;First, to delay everything until
      after New Year, when Mrs. Minster&rsquo;s interest becomes due and can&rsquo;t be
      paid. That can be done by denying jurisdiction of the State court in the
      trust business, and by asking for particulars in the receiver matter. The
      next thing is to make Thessaly too hot for those women, and for Tracy,
      too, before New Year. If a mob should smash all the widow&rsquo;s windows for
      her, for instance, perhaps burn her stable, she&rsquo;d be mighty glad to get
      out of town, and out of the iron business, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that wouldn&rsquo;t shut Tracy up,&rdquo; observed Tenney. &ldquo;He sticks at things
      like a bull-dog, once he gets a good hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about Tracy,&rdquo; mused the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace found himself regarding these two visitors of his with something
      like admiration. The resourcefulness and resolution of their villainy were
      really wonderful. He felt his courage coming back to him. Such men would
      be sure to win, if victory were not absolutely impossible. At least, there
      was nothing for it but to cordially throw in his lot with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is decided upon, I&rsquo;ll do my share,&rdquo; he said, with decision. Upon
      reflection, he added: &ldquo;But if I share the risks, I must be clearly
      understood to also share the profits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Wendover looked at the young man sternly, and breathed hard as he
      looked. &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he growled at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the cheekiest young
      cub I&rsquo;ve seen since before the war!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace stood to his guns. &ldquo;However that may be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you see what I
      mean. This is a highly opportune time, it strikes me, to discover just how
      I stand in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stand where you&rsquo;re put, or it will be the worse for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Schuyler Tenney interposed, &ldquo;you ought to have confidence that
      we will do the fair thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bosom may be simply overflowing with confidence in you both&rdquo;&mdash;Horace
      ventured upon a suggestion of irony in his intonation&mdash;&ldquo;but
      experience seems to indicate the additional desirability of an
      understanding. If you will think it over, I daresay you will gather the
      force of my remark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The New Yorker seemed not to have heard the remark, much less to have
      understood it. He addressed the middle space between Horace and Tenney in
      a meditative way: &ldquo;Those two speech-making fellows who are here from the
      Amalgamated Confederation of Labor, or whatever it is, can both be had to
      kick up a row whenever we like. I know them both of old. They notified me
      that they were coming here ten days ago. We can tell them to keep their
      hands off the Canadians when they come next week, and lead their crowd
      instead up to the Minster house. We&rsquo;ll go over that together, Tenney,
      later on. But about Tracy&mdash;perhaps these fellows might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wendover followed up the train of this thought in silence, with a
      ruminative eye on vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I was saying,&rdquo; insisted Horace, &ldquo;was that I wanted to know just how
      I stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s out of the question to square Tracy,&rdquo; pursued Wendover,
      thinking aloud, &ldquo;and that Judge Waller that he&rsquo;s applied to, he&rsquo;s just
      another such an impracticable cuss. There&rsquo;s no security for business at
      all, when such fellows have the power to muddle and interfere with it.
      Tenney, <i>you</i> know this Tracy. Why can&rsquo;t you think of something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I remarked before,&rdquo; Horace interposed once more, &ldquo;what am I to get out
      of this thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the New Yorker heard him. He slowly turned his round,
      white-framed face toward the speaker, and fixed upon him a penetrating
      glance of wrath, suspicion, and dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i> is what you want to know, is it?&rdquo; he said, abruptly,
      after a momentary silence. &ldquo;Well, sir, if you had your deserts, you&rsquo;d get
      about seven years&rsquo; hard labor. As it is, you&rsquo;ve had over seven thousand
      dollars out of the concern, and you&rsquo;ve done seven hundred thousand
      dollars&rsquo; worth of damage. If you can make a speech before Judge Waller
      this week that will stave off all these things until after New Year&rsquo;s,
      perhaps I may forgive you some of the annoyance and loss your infernal
      idiocy and self-conceit have caused us. When you&rsquo;ve done that, it will be
      time enough to talk to me about giving you another chance to keep your
      salary. But understand this, sir! You never made a bigger mistake in your
      life than in thinking you could dictate terms to Peter Wendover, now or
      any other time! Why, you poor empty-headed creature, who do you suppose <i>you</i>
      could frighten? You&rsquo;re as helpless as a June-bug in a cistern with the
      curb shut down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge had risen while speaking, and put on his overcoat. He took his
      hat now, and glanced to note that Tenney was also on his feet. Then he
      added these further words to the young man, whose head was drooping in
      spite of himself, and whose figure had sunk into a crouching posture in
      the easy-chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me give you some advice. Take precious good care not to annoy me any
      more while this business is on. I never did take much stock in you. It was
      Tenney who picked you out, and who thought you could be useful. I didn&rsquo;t
      believe in you from the start. Now that I&rsquo;ve summered and wintered you, I
      stand amazed, by God! that I could ever have let you get mixed up in my
      affairs. But here you are, and it will be easier for us to put up with
      you, and carry you along, than throw you out. Besides, you may be able to
      do some good, if what I&rsquo;ve said puts any sense into your head. But don&rsquo;t
      run away with the idea that you are necessary to us, or that you are going
      to share anything, as you call it, or that you can so much as lift your
      finger against us without first of all crushing yourself. This is plain
      talk, and it may help you to size yourself up as you really are. According
      to your own notion of yourself, God Almighty&rsquo;s overcoat would have about
      made you a vest. My idee of you is different, you see, and I&rsquo;m a good deal
      nearer right than you are. I&rsquo;ll send the papers over to you to-morrow, and
      let us see what you will do with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The New York magnate turned on his heel at this, and, without any word of
      adieu, he and Tenney left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace sat until long after midnight in his chair, with the bottle before
      him, half-dazed and overwhelmed amidst the shapeless ruins of his
      ambition.

      CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;THE MISTS CLEARING AWAY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>EUBEN Tracy rose
      at an unwontedly early hour next morning, under the spur of consciousness
      that he had a very busy day before him. While he was still at his
      breakfast in the hotel dining-room, John Fairchild came to keep an
      appointment made the previous evening, and the two men were out on the
      streets together before Thessaly seemed wholly awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first visit was to the owner of the building which the Citizens&rsquo;
      Club had thought of hiring, and their business here was promptly
      despatched; thence they made their way to the house of a boss-carpenter,
      and within the hour they had called upon a plumber, a painter, and one or
      two other master artisans. By ten o&rsquo;clock those of this number with whom
      arrangements had been made had put in an appearance at the building in
      question, and Tracy and Fairchild explained to them the plans which they
      were to carry out. The discussion and settlement of these consumed the
      time until noon, when the lawyer and the editor separated, and Reuben went
      to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, as had been arranged, he found old &rsquo;Squire Gedney waiting for
      him. A long interview behind the closed door of the inner office followed,
      and when the two men came out the justice of the peace was putting a roll
      of bills into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Tuesday,&rdquo; he said to Tracy. &ldquo;I daresay I can be back by Thursday.
      The bother about it is that Cadmus is such an out-of-the-way place to get
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, I&rsquo;ll count on seeing you Friday morning,&rdquo; answered Reuben.
      &ldquo;Then, if you&rsquo;ve got what I expect, we can go before the county judge and
      get our warrants by Saturday, and that will be in plenty of time for the
      grand jury next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t all eat their Christmas dinner in Auburn prison, call me a
      Dutchman!&rdquo; was Gedney&rsquo;s confident remark, as he took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben, thus left alone, walked up and down the larger room in pleased
      excitement, his hands in his pockets and his eyes aglow with satisfaction.
      So all-pervasive was his delight that it impelled him to song, and he
      hummed to himself as he paced the floor a faulty recollection of a tune
      his mother had been fond of, many years before. Reuben had no memory for
      music, and knew neither the words nor the air, but no winged outburst of
      exultation from a triumphant Viking in the opera could have reflected a
      more jubilant mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had unearthed the conspiracy, seized upon its avenues of escape,
      laboriously traced all its subterranean burrowings. Even without the proof
      which it was to be hoped that Gedney could bring from Cadmus, Reuben
      believed he had information enough to justify criminal proceedings.
      Nothing could be clearer than guilty collusion between this New Yorker,
      Wendover, and some of the heads of the pig-iron trust to rob Mrs. Minster
      and her daughters. At almost every turn and corner in the ramification of
      the huge swindle, Tenney and Boyce also appeared. They too should not
      escape. Reuben Tracy was the softest-hearted of men, but it did not occur
      to him to relent when he thought of his late partner. To the contrary,
      there was a decided pleasure in the reflection that nothing could avert
      well-merited punishment from this particular young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triumph had its splendid public side, moreover. Great and lasting good
      must follow such an exposure as he would make of the economic and social
      evils underlying the system of trusts. A staggering blow would be dealt to
      the system, and to the sentiment back of it that rich men might do what
      they liked in America. With pardonable pride he thrilled at the thought
      that his arm was to strike this blow. The effect would be felt all over
      the country. It could not but affect public opinion, too, on the subject
      of the tariff&mdash;that bomb-proof cover under which these men had
      conducted their knavish operations. Reuben sang with increased fervor as
      this passed through his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way back from luncheon&mdash;which he still thought of as dinner&mdash;Reuben
      Tracy stopped for a few moments at the building he and Fairchild had
      rented. The carpenters were already at work, ripping down the partitions
      on the ground floor, in a choking and clamorous confusion of dust and
      sound of hammering. The visible energy of these workmen and the noise they
      made were like a sympathetic continuation of his song of success. He would
      have enjoyed staying for hours, watching and listening to these proofs
      that he at last was doing something to help move the world around.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came out upon the street again, it was to turn his steps to the
      house of the Minsters. He had not been there since his visit in March, and
      there was a certain embarrassment about his going now. It was really Mrs.
      Minster&rsquo;s house, and he had been put in the position of acting against
      her, as counsel for her daughters. It was therefore a somewhat delicate
      business. But Miss Kate had asked him to come, and he would be sincerely
      glad of the opportunity of telling Mrs. Minster the whole truth, if she
      would listen to it. Just what form this opportunity might take he could
      not foresee; but his duty was so clear, and his arguments must carry such
      absolute conviction, that he approached the ordeal with a light heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kate came down into the drawing-room to receive him, and Reuben noted
      with a deep joy that she again wore the loose robe of creamy cloth,
      girdled by that same enchanted rope of shining white silk. Something made
      him feel, too, that she observed the pleased glance of recognition he
      bestowed upon her garments, and understood it, and was not vexed. Their
      relations had been distinctly cordial&mdash;even confidential&mdash;for
      the past fortnight; but the reappearance of this sanctified and symbolical
      gown&mdash;this mystical robe which he had enshrined in his heart with
      incense and candles and solemn veneration, as does the Latin devotee with
      the jewelled dress of the Bambino&mdash;seemed of itself to establish a
      far more tender intimacy between them. He became conscious, all at once,
      that she knew of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked mamma to see you,&rdquo; she said, when they were seated, &ldquo;and I
      think she will. Since it was first suggested to her, she has wavered a
      good deal, sometimes consenting, sometimes not. The poor lady is almost
      distracted with the trouble in which we have all become involved, and that
      makes it all the more difficult for her to see things in their proper
      connection. I hope you may be able to show her just how matters stand, and
      who her real friends are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl left at this, and in a few moments reappeared with her mother, to
      whom she formally presented Mr. Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Minster had suffered great mental anguish since the troubles came
      on, her countenance gave no hint of the fact. It was as regular and
      imperturbable and deceptively impressive as ever, and she bore herself
      with perfect self-possession, bowing with frosty precision, and seating
      herself in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben himself began the talk by explaining that the steps which he had
      felt himself compelled to take in the interest of the daughters implied
      not the slightest hostility to the mother. They had had, in fact, the
      ultimate aim of helping her as well. He had satisfied himself that she was
      in the clutch of a criminal conspiracy to despoil her estate and that of
      her daughters. It was absolutely necessary to act with promptness, and, as
      he was not her lawyer, to temporarily and technically separate the
      interest of her daughters from her own, for legal purposes. All that had
      been done was, however, quite as much to her advantage as to that of her
      daughters, and when he had explained to her the entire situation he felt
      sure she would be willing to allow him to represent her as well as her
      daughters in the effort to protect the property and defeat the conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster offered no comment upon this expression of confidence, and
      Reuben went on to lay before her the whole history of the case. He did
      this with great clearness&mdash;as if he had been talking to a child&mdash;pointing
      out to her how the scheme of plunder originated, where its first
      operations revealed themselves, and what part in turn each of the three
      conspirators had played.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened to it all with an expressionless face, and though she must
      have been startled and shocked by a good deal of it, Reuben could gather
      no indication from her manner of her feelings or her opinions. When he had
      finished, and his continued silence rendered it clear that he was not
      going to say any more, she made her first remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said, with no sign of emotion.
      &ldquo;It was very kind of you to explain it to me. But of course <i>they</i>
      explain it quite differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; answered Reuben. &ldquo;That is just what they would do. The
      difference is that they have lied to you, and that I have told you what
      the books, what the proofs, really show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known Peter Wendover since we were children together,&rdquo; she said,
      after a momentary pause, &ldquo;and <i>he</i> never would have advised my
      daughters to sue their own mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben suppressed a groan. &ldquo;Nobody has sued you, Mrs. Minster; least of
      all, your daughters,&rdquo; he tried to explain. &ldquo;The actions I have brought&mdash;that
      is, including the applications&mdash;are directed against the men who have
      combined to swindle you, not at all against you. They might just as well
      have been brought in your name also, only that I had no power to act for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same as suing me. Judge Wendover said so,&rdquo; was her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I seek to have you realize is that Judge Wendover purposely misleads
      you. He is the head and front of the conspiracy to rob you. I am going to
      have him indicted for it. The proofs are as plain as a pikestaff. How,
      then, can you continue to believe what he tells you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite believe that you mean well, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;But
      lawyers, you know, always take opposite sides. One lawyer tells you one
      thing; then the other swears to precisely the contrary. Don&rsquo;t think I
      blame them. Of course they have to do it. But you know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little more of this hopeless conversation ensued, and then Mrs. Minster
      rose. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me drive you away, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; she said, as he too got
      upon his feet. &ldquo;But if you will excuse me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had so much worry
      lately&mdash;and these headaches come on every afternoon now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Reuben walked beside her to open the door, he ventured to say: &ldquo;It is a
      very dear wish of mine, Mrs. Minster, to remove all this cause for worry,
      and to get you back control over your property, and to rid you of these
      scoundrels, root and branch. For your own sake and that of your daughters,
      let me beg of you to take no step that will embarrass me in the fight.
      There is nothing that you could do now to specially help me, except to do
      nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean for me not to sue my daughters,&rdquo; she said, as he opened the
      door, &ldquo;you may rest easy. Nothing would tempt me to do <i>that!</i> The
      very idea of such a thing is too dreadful. Good-day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben this time did not repress the groan, after he had closed the door
      upon Mrs. Minster. He realized that he had made no more impression on her
      mind than ordnance practice makes on a sandbank. He did not attempt to
      conceal his dejection as he returned to where Kate sat, and resumed his
      chair in front of her. The daughter&rsquo;s smiling face, however, partially
      reassured him, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mamma all over,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful how
      those old race types reappear, even in our day? She is as Dutch as any
      lady of Haarlem that Franz Hals ever painted. Her mind works sidewise,
      like a crab. I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad you told her everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only feel that it had had any result,&rdquo; said Reuben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it will have!&rdquo; the girl insisted confidently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she liked
      you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me&mdash;&rdquo; the lawyer spoke musingly&mdash;&ldquo;I think I was
      told once that she didn&rsquo;t like me; that she stipulated that I was not to
      be consulted about her business by&mdash;by my then partner. I wonder why
      that was. Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; said Kate. Then she stopped, and a delicate shadowy
      flush passed over her face. &ldquo;But it was nothing,&rdquo; she added, hastily,
      after a long pause. She could not bring herself to mention that year-old
      foolish gossip about the Lawton girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben did not press for an answer, but began telling her about the work
      he and Fairchild had inaugurated that morning. &ldquo;We are not going to wait
      for the committee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The place can be in some sort of shape
      within a week, I hope, and then we are going to open it as a reading-room
      first of all, where every man of the village who behaves himself can be
      free to come. There will be tea and coffee at low prices; and if the
      lockout continues, I&rsquo;ve got plans for something else&mdash;a kind of
      soup-kitchen. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t attempt to put the thing on a business basis at
      all until the men have got to work again. Then we will leave it to them,
      as to how they will support it, and what shall be done with the other
      rooms. By the way, I haven&rsquo;t seen much lately of the Lawton girl&rsquo;s
      project. I&rsquo;ve heard vaguely that a start had been made, and that it seemed
      to work well. Are you pleased with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate answered in a low voice: &ldquo;I have never been there but once since we
      met there last winter. I did what I promised, in the way of assistance,
      but I did not go again. I too have heard vaguely that it was a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben looked such obvious inquiry that that young lady felt impelled to
      explain: &ldquo;The very next day after I went there last with the money and the
      plan, I heard some very painful things about the girl&mdash;about her
      present life, I mean&mdash;from a friend, or rather from one whom I took
      then to be a friend; and what he said prejudiced me, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A swift intuition helped Reuben to say: &ldquo;By a friend&rsquo; you mean Horace
      Boyce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate nodded her head in assent. As for Reuben, he rose abruptly from his
      seat, motioning to his companion to keep her chair. He thrust his hands
      into his pockets, and began pacing up and down along the edge of the sofa
      at her side, frowning at the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Kate,&rdquo; he said at last, in a voice full of strong feeling, &ldquo;there is
      no possibility of my telling you what an infernal blackguard that man is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has behaved very badly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose I am to blame for
      having listened to him at all. But he had seen me there at her place,
      through the glass door, and he seemed so anxious to keep me from being
      imposed upon, and possibly compromised, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; broke in Reuben, &ldquo;you have no earthly idea of the
      cruelty and meanness of what he did by saying that to you. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;or
      yes, why shouldn&rsquo;t I? The fact is that that poor girl&mdash;and when she
      was at my school she was as honest and good and clever a child as I ever
      saw in my life&mdash;owed her whole misery and wretchedness to Horace
      Boyce. I never dreamed of it, either at the time or later; in fact, until
      the very day I met you at the milliner&rsquo;s shop. Somehow I mentioned that he
      was my partner, and then she told me. And then, knowing that, I had to sit
      still all summer and see him coming here every day, on intimate terms with
      you and your sister and mother.&rdquo; Reuben stopped himself with the timely
      recollection that this was an unauthorized emotion, and added hurriedly:
      &ldquo;But I never could have imagined such baseness, to deliberately slander
      her to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate did not at once reply, and when she did speak it was to turn the talk
      away from Horace Boyce. &ldquo;I will go and see her to-morrow,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; was Reuben&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;It is like
      you to say it,&rdquo; he went on, with brightening eyes. &ldquo;It is a benediction to
      be the friend of a young woman like you, who has no impulses that are not
      generous, and whose only notion of power is to help others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not like you if you begin to flatter,&rdquo; she replied, with mock
      austerity, and an answering light in her eyes. &ldquo;I am really a very
      perverse and wrong-headed girl, distinguished only for having never done
      any good at all. And anybody who says otherwise is not a friend, but a
      flatterer, and I am weary of false tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ethel came in while Reuben was still turning over in his mind the
      unexpressed meanings of these words, and with her entrance the talk became
      general once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer described to the two sisters the legal steps he had taken, and
      their respective significance, and then spoke of his intention to make a
      criminal complaint as soon as some additional proof, now being sought,
      should come to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel clapped her hands. &ldquo;And Horace Boyce will go to prison, then?&rdquo; she
      asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a strong case against him,&rdquo; answered Reuben.
    </p>
    <p>
      The graveness of his tone affected the girl&rsquo;s spirits, and led her to say
      in an altered voice: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be unkind, and I daresay I shall be
      silly enough to cry in private if the thing really happens; but when I
      think of the trouble and wickedness he has been responsible for, and of
      the far more terrible mischief he might have wrought in this family if I&mdash;that
      is, if we had not come to you as we did, I simply <i>hate</i> him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk about him any more, puss,&rdquo; said Kate, soberly, rising
      as she spoke.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;JESSICA&rsquo;S GREAT DESPAIR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was on the
      following day that a less important member of society than Miss Minster
      resolved to also pay a visit to the milliner&rsquo;s shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Lawton&rsquo;s second wife&mdash;for she herself scarcely thought of &ldquo;Mrs.
      Lawton&rdquo; as a title appertaining to her condition of ill-requited servitude&mdash;had
      become possessed of some new clothes. Their monetary value was not large,
      but they were warm and respectable, with bugle trimming on the cloak, and
      a feather rising out of real velvet on the bonnet; and they were new all
      together at the same time, a fact which impressed her mind by its novelty
      even more than did the inherent charm of acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go out in this splendid apparel was an obvious duty. Where to go was
      less clear. The notion of going shopping loomed in the background of Mrs.
      Lawton&rsquo;s thoughts for a while, but in a formless and indistinct way, and
      then disappeared again. Her mind was not civilized enough to assimilate
      the idea of loitering around among the stores when she had no money with
      which to buy anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the conception of a visit to her step-Jessica took shape in her
      imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the fact that she owed her new clothes to the bounty of this girl
      helped forward this decision. There was also a certain curiosity to see
      the child who was Ben&rsquo;s grandson, and so indirectly related to her, and
      for whose anomalous existence there was more than one precedent in her own
      family, and who might turn out to resemble her own little lost Alonzo. But
      the consideration which primarily dictated her choice was that there was
      no other place to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reception by Jessica, when she finally found her way by Samantha&rsquo;s
      complicated directions to the shop, was satisfactorily cordial. She was
      allowed to linger for a time in the show-room, and satiate bewilderment
      over the rich plumes, and multi-colored velvets and ribbons there
      displayed; then she was taken into the domestic part of the building,
      where she was asked like a real visitor to take off her cloak and bonnet,
      and sat down to enjoy the unheard-of luxury of seeing somebody else
      getting a &ldquo;meal of victuals&rdquo; ready. The child was playing by himself back
      of the stove with some blocks. He seemed to take no interest in his new
      relation, and Mrs. Lawton saw that if Alonzo had lived he would not have
      looked like this boy, who was blonde and delicate, with serious eyes and
      flaxen curls, and a high, rather protuberant forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brevet grandmother heard with surprise from Lucinda that this
      five-year-old child already knew most of his letters. She stole furtive
      glances at him after this, from time to time, and as soon as Jessica had
      gone out into the store and closed the door she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t his head look to you like water on the brain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda shook her head emphatically: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s healthy enough,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name&rsquo;s Horace, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lawton burned to ask what other name the lad bore, but the peremptory
      tones of her daughter warned her off. Instead she remarked: &ldquo;And so he&rsquo;s
      been livin&rsquo; in Tecumseh all this while? They seem to have brung him up
      pretty good&mdash;teachin&rsquo; him his A B C&rsquo;s and curlin&rsquo; his hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a good home. Jess paid high, and the people took a liking to him,&rdquo;
       said Lucinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose they died or broke up housekeepin&rsquo;,&rdquo; tentatively suggested Mrs.
      Lawton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: Jess wanted him here, or thought she did.&rdquo; Lucinda&rsquo;s loyalty to her
      sister prompted her to stop the explanation at this. But she herself had
      been sorely puzzled and tried by the change which had come over the little
      household since the night of the boy&rsquo;s arrival, and the temptation to put
      something of this into words was too strong to be mastered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish myself he hadn&rsquo;t come at all,&rdquo; she continued from the table where
      she was at work. &ldquo;Not but that he&rsquo;s a good enough young-one, and lots of
      company for us both, but Jess ain&rsquo;t been herself at all since she brought
      him here. It ain&rsquo;t his fault&mdash;poor little chap&mdash;but she fetched
      him from Tecumseh on account of something special; and then that something
      didn&rsquo;t seem to come off, and she&rsquo;s as blue as a whetstone about it, and
      that makes everything blue. And there we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda finished in a sigh, and proceeded to rub grease on the inside of
      her cake tins with a gloomy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the outer shop, Jessica found herself standing surprised and silent
      before the sudden apparition of a visitor whom she had least of all
      expected&mdash;Miss Kate Minster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell which formerly jangled when the street door opened had been taken
      off because it interfered with the child&rsquo;s mid-day sleep, and Jessica
      herself had been so deeply lost in a brown study where she sat sewing
      behind the counter that she had not noted the entrance of the young lady
      until she stood almost within touch. Then she rose hurriedly, and stood
      confused and tongue-tied, her work in hand. She dropped this impediment
      when Miss Minster offered to shake hands with her, but even this friendly
      greeting did not serve to restore her self-command or induce a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a thousand apologies to make for leaving you alone all this
      while,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;But&mdash;we have been so troubled of late&mdash;and,
      selfish like, I have forgotten everything else. Or no&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say
      that&mdash;for I have thought a great deal about you and your work. And
      now you must tell me all about both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minster had seated herself as she spoke, and loosened the boa about
      her throat, but Jessica remained standing. She idly noted that no equipage
      and coachman were in waiting outside, and let the comment drift to her
      tongue. &ldquo;You walked, I see,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Kate. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t pleasant to take out the horses now. The
      streets are full of men out of work, and they blame us for it, and to see
      us drive about seems to make them angry. I suppose it&rsquo;s a natural enough
      feeling; but the boys pelted our coachman with snowballs the other day,
      while my sister and I were driving, and the men on the corner all laughed
      and encouraged them. But if I walk nobody molests me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady, as she said this with an air of modest courage, had never
      looked so beautiful before in Jessica&rsquo;s eyes, or appealed so powerfully to
      her liking and admiration. But the milliner was conscious of an invasion
      of other and rival feelings which kept her face smileless and hardened the
      tone of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the men feel very bitterly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know that from the girls.
      A good many of them&mdash;pretty nearly all, for that matter&mdash;have
      stopped coming here, since the lockout, because <i>your</i> money
      furnished the Resting House. That shows how strong the feeling is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amaze me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no pretence in Miss Kate&rsquo;s emotion. She looked at Jessica with
      wide-open eyes, and the astonishment in the gaze visibly softened and
      saddened into genuine pain. &ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i> so sorry!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never
      thought of <i>that</i>. Tell me&mdash;what can be done? How can we get
      that cruel notion out of their heads? I did so <i>truly</i> want to help
      the girls. Surely there must be some way of making them realize this. The
      closing of the works, that is a business matter with which I had nothing
      to do, and which I didn&rsquo;t approve; but this plan of yours, <i>that</i> was
      really a pet of mine. It is only by a stupid accident that I did not come
      here often, and get to know the girls, and show them how interested I was
      in everything. When Mr. Tracy spoke of you yesterday, I resolved to come
      at once, and tell you how ashamed I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica&rsquo;s heart was deeply stirred by this speech, and filled with
      yearnings of tenderness toward the beautiful and good patrician. But some
      strange, undefined force in her mind held all this softness in subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls are gone,&rdquo; she said, almost coldly. &ldquo;They will not come back&mdash;at
      least for a long time, until all this trouble is forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hate me too much,&rdquo; groaned Kate, in grieved self-abasement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know <i>you!</i> What they think of is that it is the Minster
      money; that is what they hate. To take away from the men with a shovel,
      and give back to the girls with a spoon&mdash;they won&rsquo;t stand that!&rdquo; The
      latent class-feeling of a factory town flamed up in Jessica&rsquo;s bosom,
      intolerant and vengeful, as she listened to her own words. &ldquo;I would feel
      like that myself, if I were in their place,&rdquo; she said, in curt conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter of the millions sat for a little in pained irresolution. She
      was conscious of impulses toward anger at the coldness, almost the
      rudeness, of this girl whom she had gone far out of and beneath her way to
      assist. Her own class-feeling, too, subtly prompted her to dismiss with
      contempt the thought of these thick-fingered, uncouth factory-girls who
      were rejecting her well-meant bounty. But kindlier feelings strove within
      her mind, too, and kept her for the moment undecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at Jessica, as if in search for help, and her woman&rsquo;s heart
      suddenly told her that the changes in the girl&rsquo;s face, vaguely apparent to
      her before, were the badges of grief and unrest. All the annoyance she had
      been nursing fled on the instant. Her eyes moistened, and she laid her
      hand softly on the other&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> at least mustn&rsquo;t think harshly of me,&rdquo; she said with a smile.
      &ldquo;That would be <i>too</i> sad. I would give a great deal if the furnaces
      could be opened to-morrow&mdash;if they had never been shut. Not even the
      girls whose people are out of work feel more deeply about the thing than I
      do. But&mdash;after all, time must soon set that right. Tell me about
      yourself. You are not looking well. Is there nothing I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An answering moisture came into Jessica&rsquo;s eyes as she met the other&rsquo;s
      look. She shook her head, and withdrew her wrist from the kindly pressure
      of Kate&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke of you at length with Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; Kate went on, gently. &ldquo;<i>Do</i>
      believe that we are both anxious to do all we can for you, in whatever
      form you like. You have never spoken about more money for the Resting
      House. Isn&rsquo;t your store about exhausted? If it is, don&rsquo;t hesitate for a
      moment to let me know. And mayn&rsquo;t I go and see the house, now that I am
      here? You know I have never been inside it once since you took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a second or two Jessica hesitated. It cost her a great deal to
      maintain the unfriendly attitude she had taken up, and she was hopelessly
      at sea as to why she was paying this price for unalloyed unhappiness. Yet
      still she persisted doggedly, and as it were in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal run down just now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Since the trouble came,
      Lucinda and I haven&rsquo;t kept it up. You&rsquo;d like better to see it some time
      when it was in order; that is, if I&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t given up
      altogether!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The despairing intonation of these closing words was not lost upon Kate.
      She looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you speak like that?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you discouraged, Jessica? Oh,
      I hope it isn&rsquo;t as bad as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking a good deal of going away. You and Miss Wilcox can put
      somebody else here, and keep open the house. It doesn&rsquo;t need me. My heart
      isn&rsquo;t in it any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl forced herself through these words with a mournful effort. The
      hot tears came to her eyes before she had finished, and she turned away
      abruptly, walking behind the counter to the front of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minster rose and went to her. &ldquo;There is something you are not telling
      me, my child,&rdquo; she urged with tender earnestness. &ldquo;What is it? Are you in
      trouble? Tell me. <i>Let</i> me help you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing&mdash;nothing at all,&rdquo; Jessica made answer. &ldquo;Only I am
      not happy here. It was a mistake to come. And there are&mdash;other things&mdash;that
      were a mistake, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not confide in me, dear? Why not let me help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could <i>you</i> help me?&rdquo; The girl spoke with momentary impatience.
      &ldquo;There are things that <i>money</i> can&rsquo;t help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rich young lady drew herself up instinctively, and tightened the fur
      about her neck. The words affected her almost like an affront.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; she said, with an obvious cooling of manner. &ldquo;I did not
      mean money alone. I had hoped you felt I was your friend. And I still want
      to be, if occasion arises. I shall be very much grieved, indeed, if you do
      not let me know, at any and all times, when I can be of use to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand, evidently as an indication that she was going.
      Jessica saw the hand through a mist of smarting tears, and took it, not
      daring to look up. She was filled with longings to kiss this hand, to cry
      out for forgiveness, to cast herself upon the soft shelter of this sweet
      friendship, so sweetly proffered. But there was some strange spell which
      held her back, and, still through the aching film of tears, she saw the
      gloved hand withdrawn. A soft &ldquo;good-by&rdquo; spread its pathos upon the silence
      about her, and then Miss Minster was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica stood for a time, looking blankly into the street. Then she turned
      and walked with unconscious directness, as in a dream, through the back
      rooms and across the yard to the Resting House. She had passed her
      stepmother, her sister, and her child without bestowing a glance upon
      them, and she wandered now through the silent building aimlessly, without
      power to think of what she saw. Although the furniture was still of the
      most primitive and unpretentious sort, there were many little appliances
      for the comfort of the girls, in which she had had much innocent delight.
      The bath-rooms on the upper floor, the willow rocking-chairs in the
      sitting-room, the neat row of cups and saucers in the glassfaced cupboard,
      the magazines and pattern books on the table&mdash;all these it had given
      her pleasure to contemplate only a fortnight ago. Now they were nothing to
      her. She noted that the fire in the base-burner had gone out, though the
      reservoir still seemed full of coal. She was conscious of a vague sense of
      fitness in its having gone out. The fire that had burned within her heart
      was in ashes, too. She put her apron to her eyes and wept vehemently, here
      in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda came out, nearly an hour later, to find her sister sitting
      disconsolate by the fireless stove, shivering with the cold, and staring
      into vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her broad arm with maternal kindness around Jessica&rsquo;s waist, and
      led her unresisting toward the door. &ldquo;Never mind, sis,&rdquo; she murmured, with
      clumsy sympathy. &ldquo;Come in and play with Horace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica, shuddering again with the chill, buried her face on her sister&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and wept supinely. There was not an atom of courage remaining in
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are low down and miserable,&rdquo; pursued Lucinda, compassionately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      make you up some boneset tea. It&rsquo;ll be lucky if you haven&rsquo;t caught your
      death a-cold out here so long.&rdquo; She had taken a shawl, which hung in the
      hallway, and wrapped it about her sister&rsquo;s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I half wish I had,&rdquo; sobbed Jessica. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fight left in me any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I knew myself,&rdquo; the girl groaned in answer, &ldquo;perhaps I could do
      something; but I don&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t think, I can&rsquo;t eat or sleep or work. O
      God! what is the matter with me?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;A STRANGE ENCOUNTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> SOMBRE excitement
      reigned in Thessaly next day, when it became known that the
      French-Cana-dian workmen whom the rolling-mill people were importing would
      arrive in the village within the next few hours. They were coming through
      from Massachusetts, and watchful eyes at Troy had noted their temporary
      halt there and the time of the train they took westward. The telegraph
      sped forward the warning, and fully a thousand idle men in Thessaly
      gathered about the dépôt, both inside and on the street without, to
      witness the unwelcome advent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some indefinite rumors of the sensation reached the secluded milliner&rsquo;s
      shop on the back street, during the day. Ben Lawton drifted in to warm
      himself during the late forenoon, and told of the stirring scenes that
      were expected. He was quick to observe that Jessica was not looking well,
      and adjured her to be careful about the heavy cold which she said she had
      taken. The claims upon him of the excitement outside were too strong to be
      resisted, but he promised to look in during the afternoon and tell them
      the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daylight of the November afternoon was beginning imperceptibly to wane
      before any further tidings of the one topic of great public interest
      reached the sisters. One of the better class of factory-girls came in to
      gossip with Lucinda, and she brought with her a veritable budget of
      information. The French Canadians had arrived, and with them came some
      Pinkerton detectives, or whatever they were called, who were said to be
      armed to the teeth. The crowd had fiercely hooted these newcomers and
      their guards, and there had been a good deal of angry hustling. For awhile
      it looked as if a fight must ensue; but, somehow, it did not come off. The
      Canadians, in a body, had gone with their escort to the row of new
      cottages which the company had hired for them, followed by a diminishing
      throng of hostile men and boys. There were numerous personal incidents to
      relate, and the two sisters listened with deep interest to the whole
      recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was finished the girl still sat about, evidently with something on
      her mind. At last, with a blunt &ldquo;Can I speak to you for a moment?&rdquo; she led
      Jessica out into the shop. There, in a whisper, with repeated affirmations
      and much detail, she imparted the confidential portion of her
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this information upon Jessica was marked and immediate. As
      soon as the girl had gone she hastened to the living-room, and began
      hurriedly putting on her boots. The effort of stooping to button them made
      her feverish head ache, and she was forced to call the amazed Lucinda to
      her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy to think of going out such a day as this,&rdquo; protested the
      girl, &ldquo;and you with such a cold, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be done,&rdquo; said Jessica, her eyes burning with eagerness, and
      her cheeks flushed. &ldquo;If it killed me, it would have to be done. But I&rsquo;ll
      bundle up warm. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo; Refusing to
      listen to further dissuasion she hastily put on her hat and cloak, and
      then with nervous rapidity wrote a note, sealed it up tightly with an
      envelope, and marked on it, with great plainness, the address: &ldquo;Miss Kate
      Minster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give this to father when he comes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and tell him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben Lawton&rsquo;s appearance at the door interrupted the directions. He was too
      excited about the events of the day to be surprised at seeing the daughter
      he had left an invalid now dressed for the street; but she curtly stopped
      the narrative which he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard all about it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want you to come with me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda watched the dominant sister drag on and button her gloves with
      apprehension and solicitude written all over her honest face. &ldquo;Now, do be
      careful,&rdquo; she repeated more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jessica said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready now,&rdquo; and turned to join her father, the little
      boy came into the shop through the open door of the living-room. A swift
      instinct prompted the mother to go to him and stoop to kiss him on the
      forehead. The child smiled at her; and when she was out in the street,
      walking so hurriedly that her father found the gait unprecedented in his
      languid experience, she still dwelt curiously in her mind upon the
      sweetness of that infantile smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this, by some strange process, suddenly brought clearness and order to
      her thoughts. Under the stress of this nervous tension, perhaps because of
      the illness which she felt in every bone, yet which seemed to clarify her
      senses, her mind was all at once working without confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw now that what had depressed her, overthrown her self-control,
      impelled her to reject the kindness of Miss Minster, had been the
      humanization, so to speak, of her ideal, Reuben Tracy. The bare thought of
      his marrying and giving in marriage&mdash;of his being in love with the
      rich girl&mdash;this it was that had so strangely disturbed her. Looking
      at it now, it was the most foolish thing in the world. What on earth had
      she to do with Reuben Tracy? There could never conceivably have entered
      her head even the most vagrant and transient notion that he&mdash;no, she
      would not put <i>that</i> thought into form, even in her own mind. And
      were there two young people in all the world who had more claim to her
      good wishes than Reuben and Kate? She answered this heartily in the
      negative, and said to herself that she truly was glad that they loved each
      other. Yes, she was glad! She bit her lips, and insisted on repeating this
      to her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why, then, had the discovery of this so unnerved her? She answered the
      question only vaguely. It must have been because the idea of their
      happiness made the isolation of her own life so miserably clear; because
      she felt that they had forgotten her and her work in their new-found
      concern for each other. Yes, that would be the reason. She was all over
      that weak folly now. She had it in her power to help them, and dim,
      half-formed wishes that she might give life itself to their service
      flitted across her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken never a word to her father all this while, and had seemed
      to take no note either of direction or of what and whom she passed; but
      she stopped now in front of the doorway in Main Street which bore the
      law-sign of Reuben Tracy. &ldquo;Wait for me here,&rdquo; she said to Ben, and
      disappeared up the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica made her way with some difficulty up the second flight. Her head
      burned with the exertion, and there was a novel numbness in her limbs; but
      she gave this only a passing thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the office was locked. On the panel was tacked a white
      half-sheet of paper. It was not easy to decipher the inscription in the
      failing light, but she finally made it out to be:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Called away until noon to-morrow (Friday)</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl leaned against the door-sill for support. In the first moment or
      two it seemed to her that she was going to swoon. Then resolution came
      back to her, and with it a new store of strength, and she went down the
      stairs again slowly and in terrible doubt as to what should now be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory suddenly came to her of the one other time she had been in this
      stairway, when she had stood in the darkness with her little boy, gathered
      up against the wall to allow the two Minster ladies to pass. Upon the
      heels of this chased the recollection&mdash;with such lack of sequence do
      our thoughts follow one another&mdash;of the singularly sweet smile her
      little boy had bestowed upon her, half an hour since, when she kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile had lingered in her mind as a beautiful picture. Walking down
      the stairs now, in the deepening shadows, the revelation dawned upon her
      all at once&mdash;it was his father&rsquo;s smile! Yes, yes&mdash;hurriedly the
      fancy reared itself in her thoughts&mdash;thus the lover of her young
      girlhood had looked upon her. The delicate, clever face; the prettily
      arched lips; the soft, light curls upon the forehead; the tenderly beaming
      blue eyes&mdash;all were the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often&mdash;alas! very often&mdash;this resemblance had forced itself upon
      her consciousness before. But now, lighted up by that chance babyish
      smile, it came to her in the guise of a novelty, and with a certain
      fascination in it. Her head seemed to have ceased to ache, now that this
      almost pleasant thought had entered it. It was passing strange, she felt,
      that any sense of comfort should exist for her in memories which had fed
      her soul upon bitterness for so long a time. Yet it was already on the
      instant apparent to her that when she should next have time to think, that
      old episode would assume less hateful aspects than it had always presented
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now there was no time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the street door she found her father leaning against a shutter and
      discussing the events of the day with the village lamplighter, who carried
      a ladder on his shoulder, and reported great popular agitation to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica beckoned Ben summarily aside, and put into his hands the letter
      she had written at the shop. &ldquo;I want you to take this at once to Miss
      Minster, at her house,&rdquo; she said, hurriedly. &ldquo;See to it that she gets it
      herself. Be sure you wait for an answer. Don&rsquo;t say a word to any living
      soul. Do just what she tells you to do. I&rsquo;ve said you can be depended
      upon. If you show yourself a man, it may make your fortune. Now, hurry;
      and I do hope you will do me credit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the spur of this surprising exhortation, Ben walked away with
      unexampled rapidity, until he had overtaken the lamplighter, from whom he
      borrowed some chewing tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, left to herself, began walking irresolutely down Main Street.
      The flaring lights in the store windows seemed to add to the confusion of
      her mind. It had appeared to be important to send her father away at once,
      but now she began to regret that she had not kept him to help her in her
      search. For Reuben Tracy must be found at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to go to work to trace him she did not know. She had no notion
      whatever as to who his intimate friends were. The best device she could
      think of would be to ask about him at the various law-offices; for she had
      heard that however much lawyers might pretend to fight one another in
      court, they were all on very good terms outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some little distance down the street she came upon the door of another
      stairway which bore a number of lawyers&rsquo; signs. The windows all up the
      front of this building were lighted, and without further examination she
      ascended the first flight of stairs. The landing was almost completely
      dark, but an obscured gleam came from the dusty transoms over three or
      four doors close about her. She knocked on one of these at random, and in
      response to an inarticulate vocal sound from within, opened the door and
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a square, medium-sized room in which she found herself, with a
      long, paper-littered table in the centre, and tall columns of light
      leather-covered books rising along the walls. At the opposite end of the
      chamber a man sat at a desk, his back turned to her, his elbows on the
      desk, and his head in his hands. The shaded light in front of him made a
      mellow golden fringe around the outline of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden bewildering tumult burst forth in the girl&rsquo;s breast as she looked
      at this figure. Then, as suddenly, the recurring mental echoes of the
      voice which had bidden her enter rose above this tumult and stilled it. A
      gentle and comforting warmth stole through her veins. This was Horace
      Boyce who sat there before her&mdash;and she did not hate him!
    </p>
    <p>
      During that instant in which she stood by the door, a whole flood of
      self-illumination flashed its rays into every recess of her mind. This,
      then, was the strange, formless opposing impulse which had warred with the
      other in her heart for this last miserable fortnight, and dragged her
      nearly to distraction. She recognized it now, and welcomed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bringing home of her boy had revived for her, by occult and subtle
      processes, the old romance in which his father had been framed, as might a
      hero be by sunlit clouds. She hugged the thought to her heart, and stood
      looking at&rsquo; him motionless and mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who is it? What is wanted?&rdquo; he called out, querulously, without
      changing his posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica moved slowly toward him. It was as if a magic voice drew her
      forward in a dream&mdash;herself all rapt and dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritably impressed by the continued silence, Horace lifted his head, and
      swung abruptly around in his chair. His own shadow obscured the features
      of his visitor. He saw only that it was a lady, and rose hesitatingly to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;I was busy with my thoughts, and did not know
      who it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know now?&rdquo; Jessica heard herself ask, as in a trance. The balmy
      warmth in her own heart told her that she was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace took a step or two obliquely forward, so that the light fell on her
      face. He peered with a confounded gaze at her for a moment, then let his
      arms fall limp at his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of the dev&mdash;&rdquo; he began, confusedly, and then bit the
      word short, and stared at her again. &ldquo;Is it really you?&rdquo; he asked at last,
      reassured in part by her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sorry to see me?&rdquo; she asked in turn. Her mind could frame nothing
      but these soft little meaningless queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man seemed in doubt how best to answer this question. He turned
      around and looked abstractedly at his desk; then with a slight detour he
      walked past her, opened the door, and glanced up and down the dark
      stairway. When he had closed the door once more, he turned the key in the
      lock, and then, after momentary reflection, concluded to unlock it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; why should I be?&rdquo; he said in a more natural voice, as he
      returned and stood beside her. Evidently her amiability was a more
      difficult surprise for him to master than her original advent, and he
      studied her face with increasing directness of gaze to make sure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down here,&rdquo; he said, after a few moments of this puzzled
      inspection, and resumed his own chair. &ldquo;I want a good look at you,&rdquo; he
      explained, as he lifted the shade from the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica felt that she was blushing under this new radiance, and it
      required an effort to return his glance. But, when she did so, the changes
      in his face and expression which it revealed drove everything else from
      her mind. She rose from her chair upon a sudden impulse, and bent over him
      at a diffident distance. As she did so, she had the feeling that this
      bitterness in which she had encased herself for years had dropped from her
      on the instant like a discarded garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Horace, your hair is quite gray!&rdquo; she said, as if the fact contained
      the sublimation of pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been trouble enough to turn it white twenty times over! You don&rsquo;t
      know what I&rsquo;ve been through, my girl,&rdquo; he said, sadly. The novel sensation
      of being sympathized with, welcome as it was, greatly accentuated his
      sense of deserving compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; she said, softly. She had seated herself again, and was
      gradually recovering her self-possession. The whole situation was so
      remarkable, not to say startling, that she found herself regarding it from
      the outside, as if she were not a component part of it. Her pulses were no
      longer strongly stirred by its personal phases. Most clear of all things
      in her mind was that she was now perfectly independent of this or any
      other man. She was her own master, and need ask favors from nobody.
      Therefore, if it pleased her to call bygones bygones and make a friend of
      Horace&mdash;or even to put a bandage across her eyes and cull from those
      bygones only the rose leaves and violet blossoms, and make for her weary
      soul a bed of these&mdash;what or who was to prevent her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some inexplicable, unforeseen revulsion of feeling had made him pleasant
      in her sight again. There was no doubt about it&mdash;she had genuine
      satisfaction in sitting here opposite him and looking at him. Had she so
      many pleasures, then, that she should throw this unlooked-for boon
      deliberately away?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover&mdash;and here the new voices called most loudly in her heart&mdash;he
      was worn and unhappy. The iron had palpably entered his soul too. He
      looked years older than he had any chronological right to look. There were
      heavy lines of anxiety on his face, and his blonde hair was powdered thick
      with silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am truly sorry,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Is it business that has gone
      wrong with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business&mdash;family&mdash;health&mdash;sleep&mdash;everything!&rdquo; he
      groaned, bitterly. &ldquo;It is literally a hell that I have been living in this
      last&mdash;these last few months!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea of that,&rdquo; she said, simply. Of course it would be
      ridiculous to ask if there was anything she could do, but she had comfort
      from the thought that he must realize what was in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me God, Jess!&rdquo; he burst out vehemently, under the incentive of
      her sympathy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to believe that every man is a scoundrel, and
      every woman a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a long time when <i>I</i> thought that,&rdquo; she said with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked quickly at her from under his brows, and then as swiftly turned
      his glance away. &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he answered uneasily, tapping with his
      fingers on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t talk of that,&rdquo; she urged, with a little tremor of anxiety in
      her tone. &ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t talk of that at all. It was merely by accident that
      I came here, Horace. I wanted to ask a question, and nothing was further
      from my head than finding you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;Mart Jocelyn had this place up to a couple of months ago.
      Was it he you came to see? I didn&rsquo;t know you knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you foolish boy!&rdquo; she said, with a smile which had a ground tone of
      sadness. &ldquo;I never heard of him before. It was simply any lawyer I was
      looking for. But what I wanted to say was that I am not angry with you any
      more. I&rsquo;ve learned a host of bitter lessons since we were&mdash;young
      together, and I&rsquo;m too much alone in the world to want to keep you an
      enemy. You don&rsquo;t seem so very happy yourself, Horace. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we two
      be friends again? I&rsquo;m not talking of anything else, Horace&mdash;understand
      me. But it appeals to me very strongly, this idea of our being friends
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace looked meditatively at her, with softening eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best
      of the lot, dear old Jess,&rdquo; he said at last, smiling candidly. &ldquo;Truly I&rsquo;m
      glad you came&mdash;gladder than I can tell you. I was in the very slough
      of despond when you entered; and now&mdash;well, at least I&rsquo;m going to
      play that I am out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica rose with a beaming countenance, and laid her hand frankly on his
      shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I came, too,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And very soon I want to see
      you again&mdash;when you are quite free&mdash;and have a long, quiet
      talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, my girl,&rdquo; he answered, rising as well. The prospect seemed
      entirely attractive to him. He took her hand in his, and said again: &ldquo;All
      right. And must you go now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy, yes!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with sudden recollection. &ldquo;I had no
      business to stay so long! Perhaps you can tell me&mdash;or no&mdash;&rdquo; She
      vaguely put together in her mind the facts that Tracy and Horace had been
      partners, and seemed to be so no longer. &ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I so poor a legal reputation as all that?&rdquo; he said, lightly smiling.
      &ldquo;Hang it all! One&rsquo;s friends, at least, ought to dissemble their bad
      opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t about law,&rdquo; she explained, stum-blingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no
      importance. I must hurry now. Good-by for the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have drawn her to him and kissed her at this, but she gently
      prevented the caress, and released herself from his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; she said, with a smile in which still some sadness lingered.
      &ldquo;I would rather not that. It is better so. And&mdash;good-by, Horace, for
      the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went with her to the door, lighting the hall gas that she might see her
      way down the stairs. When she had disappeared, he walked for a little up
      and down the room, whistling softly to himself. It was undeniable that the
      world seemed vastly brighter to him than it had only a half-hour before.
      Mere contact with somebody who liked him for himself was a refreshing
      novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A damned decent sort of girl&mdash;considering everything!&rdquo; he mused
      aloud, as he locked up his desk for the day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;THE ALARM AT THE FARMHOUSE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o come upon the
      street again was like the confused awakening from a dream. With the first
      few steps Jessica found herself shivering in an extremity of cold, yet
      still uncomfortably warm. A sudden passing spasm of giddiness, too, made
      her head swim so that for the instant she feared to fall. Then, with an
      added sense of weakness, she went on, wearily and desponding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of this novel and curious happiness upon which she had
      stumbled only a few moments before took on now the character of
      self-reproach. The burning headache had returned, and with it came a
      pained consciousness that it had been little less than criminal in her to
      weakly dally in Horace&rsquo;s office when such urgent responsibility rested
      upon her outside. If the burden of this responsibility appeared too great
      for her to bear, now that her strength seemed to be so strangely leaving
      her, there was all the more reason for her to set her teeth together, and
      press forward, even if she staggered as she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only&mdash;where to find Reuben Tracy! The search had been made cruelly
      hopeless by that shameful delay; and she blamed herself with fierceness
      for it, as she racked her brain for some new plan, wondering whether she
      ought to have asked Horace or gone into some of the other offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were groups of men standing here and there on the comers&mdash;a
      little away from the full light of the street-lamps, as if unwilling to
      court observation. These knots of workmen had a sinister significance to
      her feverish mind. She had the clew to the terrible mischief which some of
      them intended&mdash;which no doubt even now they were canvassing in
      furtive whispers&mdash;and only Tracy could stop it, and she was powerless
      to find him!
    </p>
    <p>
      There came slouching along the sidewalk, as she grappled with this anguish
      of irresolution, a slight and shabby figure which somehow arrested her
      attention. It was a familiar enough figure&mdash;that of old &ldquo;Cal&rdquo; Gedney;
      and there was nothing unusual or worthy of comment in the fact that he was
      walking unsteadily by himself, with his gaze fixed intently on the
      sidewalk. He had passed again out of the range of her cursory glance
      before she suddenly remembered that he was a lawyer, and even some kind of
      a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned swiftly and almost ran after him, clutching his sleeve as she
      came up to him, and breathing so hard with weakness and excitement that
      for the moment she could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &rsquo;squire looked up, and angrily shook his arm out of her grasp.
      &ldquo;Leave me alone, you hussy,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll lock you up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His misconstruction of her purpose cleared her mind. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo;
       she said, hurriedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of perhaps life and death! Do you
      know where Reuben Tracy is? Or can you tell me where I can find out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with <i>you</i>, wherever he is,&rdquo; was the
      surly response. &ldquo;Be off with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you it was a matter of life and death,&rdquo; she insisted, earnestly.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never forgive you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never forgive yourself&mdash;if you
      know and won&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sincerity of the girl&rsquo;s tone impressed the old man. It was not easy
      for him to stand erect and unaided without swaying, but his mind was
      evidently clear enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with him?&rdquo; he asked, in a less unfriendly voice. Then he
      added, in a reflective undertone: &ldquo;Cur&rsquo;ous&rsquo;t I sh&rsquo;d want see Tracy, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do know where he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s drove out to &rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s farm. Seems word come old woman&rsquo;s
      sick. You&rsquo;re one of that Lawton tribe, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I get a cutter, will you drive out there with me?&rdquo; She asked the
      question with swift directness. She added in explanation, as he stared
      vacantly at her: &ldquo;I ask that because you said you wanted to see him,
      that&rsquo;s all. I shall go alone if you won&rsquo;t come. He&rsquo;s <i>got</i> to be back
      here this evening, or God only knows what&rsquo;ll happen! I mean what I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the road?&rdquo; the &rsquo;squire asked, catching something of
      her own eager spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every inch of it! I was bom half a mile from where his mother lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t tell me what your business is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you this much,&rdquo; she whispered, hastily. &ldquo;There is going to be a
      mob at the Minster house to-night. A girl who knows one of the men told&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old &rsquo;squire cut short the revelation by grasping her arm with
      fierce energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on&mdash;come on!&rdquo; he said, hoarsely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste a minute. By God!
      We&rsquo;ll gallop the horses both ways.&rdquo; He muttered to himself with excitement
      as he dragged her along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica waited outside the livery stable for what seemed an interminable
      period, while old &ldquo;Cal&rdquo; was getting the horses&mdash;walking up and down
      the path in a state of mental torment which precluded all sense of bodily
      suffering. When she conjured up before her frightened mind the terrible
      consequences which delay might entail, every minute became an intolerable
      hour of torture. There was even the evil chance that the old man had been
      refused the horses because he had been drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, however, there came the welcome sound of mailed hoofs on the
      plank roadway inside, and the reverberating jingle of bells; and then the
      &rsquo;squire, with a spacious double-seated sleigh containing plenty of
      robes, drew up in front of a cutting in the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the front seat without hesitation, and gathered the lines into
      her own hands. &ldquo;Let me drive,&rdquo; she said, clucking the horses into a rapid
      trot. &ldquo;I <i>should</i> be home in bed. I&rsquo;m too ill to sit up, unless I&rsquo;m
      doing something that keeps me from giving up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben Tracy felt the evening in the sitting-room of the old farmhouse to
      be the most trying ordeal of his adult life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily he rather enjoyed than otherwise the company of his brother
      Ezra&mdash;a large, powerfully built, heavily bearded man, who sat now
      beside him in a rocking-chair in front of the wood stove, his stockinged
      feet on the hearth, and a last week&rsquo;s agricultural paper on his knee. Ezra
      was a worthy and hard-working citizen, with an original way of looking at
      things, and considerable powers of expression. As a rule, the lawyer liked
      to talk with him, and felt that he profited in ideas and suggestions from
      the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night he found his brother insufferably dull, and the task of
      keeping down the &ldquo;fidgets&rdquo; one of incredible difficulty. His mother&mdash;on
      whose account he had been summoned&mdash;was so much better that Ezra&rsquo;s
      wife had felt warranted in herself going off to bed, to get some
      much-needed rest. Ezra had argued for a while, rather perversely, about
      the tariff duty on wool, and now was nodding in his chair, although the
      dim-faced old wooden clock showed it to be barely eight o&rsquo;clock. The
      kerosene lamp on the table gave forth only a feeble, reddened light
      through its smoky chimney, but diffused a most powerful odor upon the
      stuffy air of the over-heated room. A ragged and strong-smelling old farm
      dog groaned offensively from time to time in his sleep behind the stove.
      Even the draught which roared through the lower apertures in front of the
      stove and up the pipe toward the chimney was irritating by the very
      futility of its vehemence, for the place was too hot already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben mused in silence upon the chances which had led him so far away
      from this drowsy, unfruitful life, and smiled as he found himself
      wondering if it would be in the least possible for him to return to it. No&mdash;no
      one ever did return. The bright boys, the restless boys, the boys of
      energy, of ambition, of yearning for culture or conquest or the mere
      sensation of living where it was really life&mdash;all went away, leaving
      none but the Ezras behind. Some succeeded; some failed; but none of them
      ever came back. And the Ezras who remained on the farms&mdash;they seemed
      to shut and bolt the doors of their minds against all idea of making their
      own lot less sterile and barren and uninviting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere mental necessity for a great contrast brought up suddenly in
      Reuben&rsquo;s thoughts a picture of the drawing-room in the home of the
      Minsters. It seemed as if the whole vast swing of the mind&rsquo;s pendulum
      separated that luxurious abode of cultured wealth from this dingy and
      barren farmhouse room. And he, who had been born and reared in this
      latter, now found himself at a loss how to spend so much as a single
      evening in its environment, so completely had familiarity with the other
      remoulded and changed his habits, his point of view, his very character.
      Curious slaves of habit&mdash;creatures of their surroundings&mdash;men
      were!
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud, peremptory knocking at the door aroused Reuben abruptly from his
      revery, and Ezra, too, opened his eyes with a start, and sitting upright
      rubbed them confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think of it, I heard a sleigh stop,&rdquo; said Reuben, rising. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
      be the doctor this time of night, can it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud be jest like him,&rdquo; commented Ezra, captiously. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
      great hand to keep dropping in, sort of casual-like, when there&rsquo;s sickness
      in the house. It all goes down in his bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer brother had also risen, and now, lamp in hand, walked heavily
      in his stocking feet to the door, and opened it half way. Some indistinct
      words passed, and then, shading the flickering flame with his huge hairy
      hand, Ezra turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody to see you, Rube,&rdquo; he said. On second thought he added to the
      visitor in a tone of formal politeness: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you step in, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica Lawton almost pushed her host aside in her impulsive response to
      his invitation. But when she had crossed the threshold the sudden change
      into a heated atmosphere seemed to go to her brain like chloroform. She
      stood silent, staring at Reuben, with parted lips and hands nervously
      twitching. Even as he, in his complete surprise, recognized his visitor,
      she trembled violently from head to foot, made a forward step, tottered,
      and fell inertly into Ezra&rsquo;s big, protecting arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed she was going to do it,&rdquo; said the farmer, not dissembling his
      pride at the alert way in which the strange woman had been caught, and
      holding up the lamp with his other hand in triumph. &ldquo;Hannah keeled over in
      that same identical way when Suky run her finger through the cogs of the
      wringing-machine, and I ketched her, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben had hurriedly come to his brother&rsquo;s assistance. The two men placed
      the fainting girl in the rocking-chair, and the lawyer began with anxious
      fumbling to loosen the neck of her cloak and draw off her gloves. Her
      fingers were like ice, and her brow, though it felt now almost equally
      cold, was covered with perspiration. Reuben rubbed her hands between his
      broad palms in a crudely informed belief that it was the right thing to
      do, while Ezra rummaged in the adjoining pantry for the household bottle
      of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica came out of her swoon with the first touch of the pungent spirit
      upon her whitened lips. She looked with weak blankness at the unfamiliar
      scene about her, until her gaze fell upon the face of the lawyer. Then she
      smiled faintly and closed her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is an old friend of mine,&rdquo; whispered Reuben to his brother, as he
      pressed the brandy once more upon her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come to in a minute. It
      must be something serious that brought her out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl languidly opened her eyes. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cal&rsquo; Ged-ney&rsquo;s asleep in the
      sleigh,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better bring him in. He&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with an obvious effort that she said this much; and now, while Ezra
      hastily pulled on his boots, her eyes closed again, and her head sank with
      utter weariness sideways upon the high back of the old-fashioned chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben stood looking at her in pained anxiety&mdash;once or twice holding
      the lamp close to her pale face, in dread of he knew not what&mdash;until
      his brother returned. Ezra had brought the horses up into the yard, and
      remained outside now to blanket them, while the old &rsquo;squire,
      benumbed and drowsy, found his way into the house. It was evident enough
      to the young lawyer&rsquo;s first glance that Gedney had been drinking heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what does this all mean?&rdquo; he demanded, with vexed asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to get on your things and race back with us, helly-to-hoot!&rdquo;
       said the &rsquo;squire. &ldquo;Quick&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t a minute to lose!&rdquo; The
      old man almost gasped in his eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, what&rsquo;s up? Have you been to Cadmus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and got my pocket full of affidavits. We can send all three of them
      to prison fast enough. But that&rsquo;ll do to-morrow; for to-night there&rsquo;s a
      mob up at the Minster place. <i>Look there!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man had gone to the window and swept the stiff curtain aside. He
      held it now with a trembling hand, so that Reuben could look out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole southern sky overhanging Thessaly was crimson with the
      reflection of a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God! it&rsquo;s the rolling mill,&rdquo; ejaculated Reuben, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite as likely it&rsquo;s the Minster house; it&rsquo;s the same direction, only
      farther off, and fires are deceptive,&rdquo; said Gedney, his excitement rising
      under the stimulus of the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben had kicked off his slippers, and was now dragging on his shoes.
      &ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; he said, working furiously at the laces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Squire Gedney helped himself generously to the brandy on the table
      as he unfolded, in somewhat incoherent fashion, his narrative. The Lawton
      girl had somehow found out that a hostile demonstration against the
      Minsters was intended for the evening, and had started out to find Tracy.
      By accident she had met him (Gedney), and they had come off in the sleigh
      together. She had insisted upon driving, and as his long journey from
      Cadmus had greatly fatigued him, he had got over into the back seat and
      gone to sleep under the buffalo robes. He knew nothing more until Ezra had
      roused him from his slumber in the sled, now at a standstill on the road
      outside, and he had awakened to discover Jessica gone, the horses wet and
      shivering in a cloud of steam, and the sky behind them all ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jee-Whitaker! Looks as if the whole town was burning,&rdquo; said Ezra, coming
      in as this recital was concluded. &ldquo;Them horses would a-got their death out
      there in another ten minutes. Guess I&rsquo;d better put &rsquo;em in the barn,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Just turn them around. I&rsquo;ve got to drive them back faster than
      they came,&rdquo; said Reuben, who had on his overcoat and hat. &ldquo;Hurry, and get
      me some thick gloves to drive in. I&rsquo;ll leave my things here. We won&rsquo;t wake
      mother up. I&rsquo;ll get you to run in to-morrow, if you will, and let me know
      how she is. Tell her I <i>had</i> to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Ezra had found the gloves and brought them, the two men for the first
      time bent an instinctive joint glance at the recumbent figure of the girl
      in the rocking-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Hannah up,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;and she can have your room. I
      guess she&rsquo;s too sick to try to go back with you. If she&rsquo;s well enough,
      I&rsquo;ll bring her in in the morning. I was going to take in some apples,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To their surprise Jessica opened her eyes and even lifted her head at
      these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I feel better now&mdash;much better. I must go back with
      Mr. Tracy. I really must.&rdquo; She rose to her feet as she spoke, and, though
      she was conscious of great dizziness and languor, succeeded by her smile
      in imposing upon her unskilled companions. Perhaps if Hannah had been &ldquo;got
      up&rdquo; she would have seen through the weak pretence of strength, and
      insisted on having matters ordered otherwise. But the men offered no
      dissent. Jessica was persuaded to drink another glass of brandy, and &rsquo;Squire
      Gedney took one without being specially urged; and then Reuben impatiently
      led the way out to the sleigh, which Ezra had turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d rather be in front with you,&rdquo; the girl said, when Reuben had
      spread the robes for her to sit in the back seat. &ldquo;Let the Judge sit
      there; he wants to sleep. I&rsquo;m not tired now, and I want to keep awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was arranged, and Reuben, with a strong hand on the tight reins,
      started the horses on their homeward rush toward the flaming horizon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;PACING TOWARD THE REDDENED SKY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or some time there
      was no conversation in the sleigh. The horses sped evenly forward, with
      their heads well in the air, as if they too were excited by the unnatural
      glare in the sky ahead. Before long there was added to the hurried regular
      beating of their hoofs upon the hard-packed track another sound&mdash;the
      snoring of the &rsquo;squire on the seat behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sense of melting in the air. Save where the intense glow of
      the conflagration lit up the sky with a fan-like spread of ruddy luminance&mdash;fierce
      orange at the central base, and then through an expanse of vermilion,
      rose, and cherry to deepening crimsons and dull reddish purples&mdash;the
      heavens hung black with snow-laden clouds. A pleasant, moist night-breeze
      came softly across the valley, bearing ever and again a solitary flake of
      snow. The effect of this mild wind was so grateful to Jessica&rsquo;s face, now
      once more burning with an inner heat, that she gave no thought to a
      curious difficulty in breathing which was growing upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrels shall pay dear for this,&rdquo; Reuben said to her, between set
      teeth, when there came a place in the road where the horses must be
      allowed to walk up hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; she said, quite in his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husky note in her voice caught his attention. &ldquo;Are you sure you are
      bundled up warm enough?&rdquo; he asked with solicitude, pulling the robe higher
      about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I&rsquo;m not very well. I caught a heavy cold yesterday,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;But it will be nothing, if only we can get there in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck her as strange when Reuben presently replied, putting the whip
      once more to the horses: &ldquo;God only knows what can be done when I do get
      there!&rdquo; It had seemed to her a matter of course that Tracy would be equal
      to any emergency&mdash;even an armed riot. There was something almost
      disheartening in this confession of self-doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at any rate they shall pay for it to-morrow,&rdquo; he broke out, angrily,
      a moment later. &ldquo;Down to the last pennyweight we will have our pound of
      flesh! My girl,&rdquo; he added, turning to look into her face, and speaking
      with deep earnestness, &ldquo;I never knew what it was before to feel wholly
      merciless&mdash;absolutely without bowels of compassion. But I will not
      abate so much as the fraction of a hair with these villains. I swear
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By an odd contradiction, his words raised a vague spirit of compunction
      within her. &ldquo;They feel very bitterly,&rdquo; she ventured to suggest. &ldquo;It is
      terrible to be turned out of work in the winter, and with families
      dependent on that work for bare existence. And then the bringing in of
      these strange workmen. I suppose that is what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben interrupted her with an abrupt laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of them,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Poor foolish fellows, I don&rsquo;t wish them any harm. I only pray
      God they haven&rsquo;t done too much harm to themselves. No: it&rsquo;s the swindling
      scoundrels who are responsible for the mischief&mdash;<i>they</i> are the
      ones I&rsquo;ll put the clamps onto to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words conveyed no meaning to her, and she kept silent until he spoke
      further: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he told you, but Gedney has brought me
      to-night the last links needed for a chain of proof which must send all
      three of these ruffians to State prison. I haven&rsquo;t had time to examine the
      papers yet, but he says he&rsquo;s got them in his pocket there&mdash;affidavits
      from the original inventor of certain machinery, about its original sale,
      and from others who were a party to it&mdash;which makes the whole fraud
      absolutely clear. I&rsquo;ll go over them to-night, when we&rsquo;ve seen this thing
      through&rdquo;&mdash;pointing vaguely with his whip toward the reddened sky&mdash;&ldquo;and
      if tomorrow I don&rsquo;t lay all three of them by the heels, you can have my
      head for a foot-ball!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand these things very well,&rdquo; said Jessica. &ldquo;Who is it you
      mean?&rdquo; It was growing still harder for her to breathe, and sharp pain came
      in her breast now with almost every respiration. Her head ached, too, so
      violently that she cared very little indeed who it was that should go to
      prison tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three of them in the scheme,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;as cold-blooded
      and deliberate a piece of robbery as ever was planned. First, there&rsquo;s a
      New York man named Wendover&mdash;they call him a Judge&mdash;a smart,
      subtle, slippery scoundrel if ever there was one. Then there&rsquo;s Schuyler
      Tenney&mdash;perhaps you know who he is&mdash;he&rsquo;s a big hardware merchant
      here; and with him in the swindle was&mdash;Good heavens! Why, I never
      thought of it before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben had stopped short in his surprise. He began whipping the horses now
      with a seeming air of exultation, and stole a momentary smile-lit glance
      toward his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just occurred to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Curious&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t given it a
      thought. Why, my girl, it&rsquo;s like a special providence. You, too, will have
      your full revenge&mdash;such revenge as you never dreamt of. The third man
      is Horace Boyce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great wave of cold stupor engulfed the girl&rsquo;s reason as she took in
      these words, and her head swam and roared as if in truth she had been
      plunged headlong into unknown depths of icy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came to the surface of consciousness again, the horses were still
      rhythmically racing along the hill-side road overlooking the village. The
      firelight in the sky had faded down now to a dull pinkish effect like the
      northern lights. Reuben was chewing an unlighted cigar, and the &rsquo;squire
      was steadily snoring behind them. It had begun to snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will send them all to prison&mdash;surely?&rdquo; she was able to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As surely as God made little apples!&rdquo; was the sententious response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was cowering under the buffalo-robe in an anguish of mind so
      terribly intense that her physical pains were all forgotten. Only her
      throbbing head seemed full of thick blood, and there was such an awful
      need that she should think clearly! She bit her lips in tortured silence,
      striving through a myriad of wandering, crowding ideas to lay hold upon
      something which should be of help.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had begun to descend the hill&mdash;a steep, uneven road full of
      drifts, beyond which stretched a level mile of highway leading into the
      village itself&mdash;when suddenly a bold thought came to her, which on
      the instant had shot up, powerful and commanding, into a very tower of
      resolution. She laid her hand on Reuben&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll change into the back seat,&rdquo; she said, in a voice
      which all her efforts could not keep from shaking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling very ill.
      It&rsquo;ll be easier for me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben at once drew up the horses, and the girl, summoning all her
      strength, managed without his help to get around the side of the sleigh,
      and under the robe, into the rear seat. The &rsquo;squire was sunk in
      such a profound sleep that she had to push him bodily over into his own
      half of the space, and the discovery that this did not waken him filled
      her with so great a delight that all her strength and self-control seemed
      miraculously to have returned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had need of them both for the task which she had imposed upon herself,
      and which now, with infinite caution and trepidation, she set herself
      about. This was nothing less than to secure the papers which the old &rsquo;squire
      had brought from Cadmus, and which, from something she remembered his
      having said, must be in the inner pocket of one of his coats. Slowly and
      deftly she opened button after button of his overcoat, and gently pushed
      aside the cloth until her hand might have free passage to and from the
      pocket, where, after careful soundings, she had discovered a bundle of
      thick papers to be resting. Then whole minutes seemed to pass before,
      having taken off her glove, she was able to draw this packet out. Once
      during this operation Reuben half turned to speak to her, and her fright
      was very great. But she had had the presence of mind to draw the robe high
      about her, and answer collectedly, and he had palpably suspected nothing.
      As for Gedney, he never once stirred in his drunken sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larceny was complete, and Jessica had been able to wrap the old man up
      again, to button the parcel of papers under her own cloak, and to draw on
      and fasten her glove once more, before the panting horses had gained the
      outskirts of the village. She herself was breathing almost as heavily as
      the animals after their gallop, and, now that the deed was done, lay back
      wearily in her seat, with pain racking her every joint and muscle, and a
      sickening dread in her mind lest there should be neither strength nor
      courage forthcoming for what remained to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a considerable distance down the street no person was visible from
      whom the eager Tracy could get news of what had happened. At last,
      however, when the sleigh was within a couple of blocks of what seemed in
      the distance to be a centre of interest, a man came along who shouted from
      the sidewalk, in response to Reuben&rsquo;s questions, sundry leading facts of
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire had started&mdash;probably incendiary&mdash;in the basement of the
      office of the Minster furnaces, some hour or so ago, and had pretty well
      gutted the building. The firemen were still playing on the ruins. An
      immense crowd had witnessed the fire, and it was the drunkenest crowd he
      had ever seen in Thessaly. Where the money came from to buy so much drink,
      was what puzzled him. The crowd had pretty well cleared off now; some said
      they had gone up to the Minster house to give its occupants a &ldquo;horning.&rdquo;
       He himself had got his feet wet, and was afraid of the rheumatics if he
      stayed out any longer. Probably he would get them, as it was. Everybody
      said that the building was insured, and some folks hinted that the company
      had it set on fire themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben impatiently whipped up the jaded team at this, with a curt &ldquo;Much
      obliged,&rdquo; and drove at a spanking pace down the street to the scene of the
      conflagration. There was not much remaining to see. The outer walls of the
      office building were still gloomily erect, but within nothing was left but
      a glowing mass of embers about level with the ground. Some firemen were
      inside the yard, but more were congregated about the water-soaked space
      where the engine still noisily throbbed, and where hot coffee was being
      passed around to them. Here, too, there was a report that the crowd had
      gone up to the Minster house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses tugged vehemently to drag the sleigh over the impedimenta of
      hose stretched along the street, and over the considerable area of bare
      stones where the snow had been melted by the heat or washed away by the
      streams from the hydrants. Then Reuben half rose in his seat to lash them
      into a last furious gallop, and, snorting with rebellion, they tore onward
      toward the seminary road.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner, three doors from the home of the Minster ladies, Reuben
      deemed it prudent to draw up. There was evidently a considerable throng in
      the road in front of the house, and that still others were on the lawn
      within the gates was obvious from the confused murmur which came
      therefrom. Some boys were blowing spasmodically on fish-horns, and rough
      jeers and loud boisterous talk rose and fell throughout the dimly visible
      assemblage. The air had become thick with large wet snowflakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben sprang from the sleigh, and, stepping backward, vigorously shook
      old Gedney into a state of semi-wakefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold these lines,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and wait here for me.&mdash;Or,&rdquo; he turned
      to Jessica with the sudden thought, &ldquo;would you rather he drove you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had been in a half-insensible condition of mind and body. At the
      question she roused herself and shook her head. &ldquo;No: let me stay here,&rdquo;
       she said, wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Reuben, squaring his broad shoulders and shaking himself to free
      his muscles after the long ride, had disappeared with an energetic stride
      in the direction of the crowd, Jessica forced herself to sit upright, and
      then to rise to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better put the blankets on the horses, if he doesn&rsquo;t come back
      right off,&rdquo; she said to the &rsquo;squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Gedney asked, still stupid with sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk up and down,&rdquo; she answered, clambering with difficulty out of
      the sleigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of sitting still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once on the sidewalk, she grew suddenly faint, and grasped a fence-picket
      for support. The hand which she instinctively raised to her heart touched
      the hard surface of the packet of papers, and the thought which this
      inspired put new courage into her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      With bowed head and a hurried, faltering step, she turned her back upon
      the Minster house and stole off into the snowy darkness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.&mdash;THE CONQUEST OF THE MOB.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ven before he
      reached the gates of the carriage-drive opening upon the Minster lawn,
      Reuben Tracy encountered some men whom he knew, and gathered that the
      people in the street outside were in the main peaceful on-lookers, who did
      not understand very clearly what was going on, and disapproved of the
      proceedings as far as they comprehended them. There was a crowd inside the
      grounds, he was told, made up in part of men who were out of work, but
      composed still more largely, it seemed, of boys and young hoodlums
      generally, who were improving the pretext to indulge in horseplay. There
      was a report that some sort of deputation had gone up on the doorstep and
      rung the bell, with a view to making some remarks to the occupants of the
      house; but that they had failed to get any answer, and certainly the whole
      front of the residence was black as night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben easily obtained the consent of several of these citizens to follow
      him, and, as they went on, the number swelled to ten or a dozen. Doubtless
      many more could have been incorporated in the impromptu procession had it
      not been so hopelessly dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer led his friends through the gate, and began pushing his way up
      the gravelled path through the crowd. No special opposition was offered to
      his progress, for the air was so full of snow now that only those
      immediately affected knew anything about it. Although the path was fairly
      thronged, nobody seemed to have any idea why he was standing there. Those
      who spoke appeared in the main to regard the matter as a joke, the point
      of which was growing more and more obscure. Except for some sporadic
      horn-blowing and hooting nearer to the house, the activity of the
      assemblage was confined to a handful of boys, who mustered among them two
      or three kerosene oil torches treasured from the last Presidential
      campaign, and a grotesque jack-o&rsquo;-lantem made of a pumpkin and elevated on
      a broom-stick. These urchins were running about among the little groups of
      bystanders, knocking off one another&rsquo;s caps, shouting prodigiously, and
      having a good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Reuben and those accompanying him approached the house, some of these
      lads raised the cry of &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the coppers!&rdquo; and the crowd at this seemed
      to close up with a simultaneous movement, while a murmur ran across its
      surface like the wind over a field of corn. This sound was one less of
      menace or even excitement than of gratification that at last something was
      going to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the boys with a torch, in the true spirit of his generation, placed
      himself in front of Reuben and marched with mock gravity at the head of
      the advancing group. This, drolly enough, lent the movement a semblance of
      authority, or at least of significance, before which the men more readily
      than ever gave way. At this the other boys with the torches and
      jack-o&rsquo;-lantem fell into line at the rear of Tracy&rsquo;s immediate supporters,
      and they in turn were followed by the throng generally. Thus whimsically
      escorted, Reuben reached the front steps of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more compact and apparently homogeneous cluster of men stood here, some
      of them even on the steps, and dark and indistinct as everything was,
      Reuben leaped to the conclusion that these were the men at least visibly
      responsible for this strange gathering. Presumably they were taken by
      surprise at his appearance with such a following. At any rate, they, too,
      offered no concerted resistance, and he mounted to the platform of the
      steps without difficulty. Then he turned and whispered to a friend to have
      the boys with the torches also come up. This was a suggestion gladly
      obeyed, not least of all by the boy with the low-comedy pumpkin, whose
      illumination created a good-natured laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy stood now, bareheaded in the falling snow, facing the throng. The
      gathering of the lights about him indicated to everybody in the grounds
      that the aimless demonstration had finally assumed some kind of form. A
      general forward movement was the first result. Then there were admonitory
      shouts here and there, under the influence of which the horn-blowing
      gradually ceased, and Tracy&rsquo;s name was passed from mouth to mouth until
      its mention took on almost the character of a personal cheer on the
      outskirts of the crowd. In answer to this two or three hostile
      interrogations or comments were bawled out, but the throng did not favor
      these, and so there fell a silence which invited Reuben to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he began, and then stopped because he had not pitched his
      voice high enough, and a whole semicircle of cries of &ldquo;louder!&rdquo; rose from
      the darkness of the central lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid of waking the fine ladies,&rdquo; called out an anonymous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Tracy, and let the pumpkin talk,&rdquo; was another shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begorrah, it&rsquo;s the pumpkin that <i>is</i> talkin&rsquo; now!&rdquo; cried a shrill
      third voice, and at this there was a ripple of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; began Reuben, in a louder tone, this time without immediate
      interruption, &ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t know precisely why you have gathered here
      at so much discomfort to yourselves, I have some things to say to you
      which I think you will regard as important. I have not seen the persons
      who live in this house since Tuesday, but while I can easily understand
      that your coming here to-night might otherwise cause them some anxiety, I
      am sure that they, when they come to understand it, will be as glad as I
      am that you <i>are</i> here, and that I am given this opportunity of
      speaking for them to you. If you had not taken this notion of coming here
      tonight, I should have, in a day or two, asked you to meet me somewhere
      else, in a more convenient place, to talk matters over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all let me tell you that the works are going to be opened
      promptly, certainly the furnaces, and unless I am very much mistaken about
      the law, the rolling mills too. I give you my word for that, as the legal
      representative of two of these women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;ll be opened with the Frenchmen!&rdquo; came a swift answering shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or will you get Chinamen?&rdquo; cried another, amid derisive laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben responded in his clearest tones: &ldquo;No man who belongs to Thessaly
      shall be crowded out by a newcomer. I give you my word for that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some scattered cheers broke out at this announcement, which promised for
      the instant to become general, and then were hushed down by the prevalent
      anxiety to hear more. In this momentary interval Reuben caught the sound
      of a window being cautiously raised immediately above the front door, and
      guessed with a little flutter of the heart who this new auditor might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secondly,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you ought to be told the truth about the shutting
      down of the furnaces and the lockout. These women were not at all
      responsible for either action. I know of my own knowledge that both things
      caused them genuine grief, and that they were shocked beyond measure at
      the proposal to bring outside workmen into the town to undersell and drive
      away their own neighbors and fellow-townsmen. I want you to realize this,
      because otherwise you would do a wrong in your minds to these good women
      who belong to Thessaly, who are as fond of our village and its people as
      any other soul within its borders, and who, for their own sake as well as
      that of Stephen Minster&rsquo;s memory, deserve respect and liking at your
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may tell you frankly that they were misled and deceived by agents, in
      whom, mistakenly enough, they trusted, into temporarily giving power to
      these unworthy men. The result was a series of steps which they deplored,
      but did not know how to stop. A few days ago I was called into the case to
      see what could be done toward undoing the mischief from which they, and
      you, and the townspeople generally, suffer. Since then I have been hard at
      work both in court and out of it, and I believe I can say with authority
      that the attempt to plunder the Minster estate and to impoverish you will
      be beaten all along the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the outburst of cheering was spontaneous and prolonged. When it
      died away, some voice called out, &ldquo;Three cheers for the ladies!&rdquo; and these
      were given, too, not without laughter at the jack-o&rsquo;-lantem boy, who waved
      his pumpkin vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; called out Tracy, &ldquo;and I hope you will take in good part
      what I am going to say. When I made my way up through the grounds, I was
      struck by the fact that nobody seemed to know just why he had come here. I
      gather now that word was passed around during the day that there would be
      a crowd here, and that something, nobody understood just what, would be
      done after they got here. I do not know who started the idea, or who
      circulated the word. It might be worth your while to find out. Meanwhile,
      don&rsquo;t you agree with me that it is an unsatisfactory and uncivil way of
      going at the thing? This is a free country, but just because it <i>is</i>
      free, we ought to feel the more bound to respect one another&rsquo;s rights.
      There are countries in which, I dare say, if I were a citizen, or rather a
      subject, I might feel it my duty to head a mob or join a riot. But here
      there ought to be no mob; there should be no room for even thought of a
      riot. Our very strength lies in the idea that we are our own policemen&mdash;our
      own soldiery. I say this not because one in a hundred of you meant any
      special harm in coming here, but because the notion of coming itself was
      not American. Beware of men who suggest that kind of thing. Beware of men
      who preach the theory that because you are puddlers or moulders or
      firemen, therefore you are different from the rest of your
      fellow-citizens. I, for one, resent the idea that because I am a lawyer,
      and you, for example, are a blacksmith, therefore we belong to different
      classes. I wish with all my heart that everybody resented it, and that
      that abominable word &lsquo;classes&rsquo; could be wiped out of the English language
      as it is spoken in America. That is all. I am glad if you feel easier in
      your minds than you did when you came. If you do, I guess there&rsquo;s been no
      harm done by your coming which isn&rsquo;t more than balanced by the good that
      has come out of it. Only next time, if you don&rsquo;t mind, we&rsquo;ll have our
      meeting somewhere else, where it will be easier to speak than it is in a
      snowstorm, and where we won&rsquo;t keep our neighbors awake. And now
      good-night, everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of the satisfied and amiable murmur which spread through the crowd at
      this, there rose a sharp, querulous voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us the names of the men who, you say, <i>were</i> responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t do that to-night. But if you read the next list of
      indictments found by the grand jury of Dearborn County, my word as a
      lawyer you&rsquo;ll find them all there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The loudest cheer of the evening burst upon the air at this, and there was
      a sustained roar when Tracy&rsquo;s name was shouted out above the tumult. Some
      few men crowded up to the steps to shake hands with him, and many others
      called out to him a personal &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo; The last of those to shake the
      accumulated snow from their collars and hats, and turn their steps
      homeward, noted that the whole front of the Minster house had suddenly
      become illuminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Reuben&rsquo;s simple and highly fortuitous conquest of what had been
      planned to be a mob was accomplished. It is remembered to this day as the
      best thing any man ever did single-handed in Thessaly, and it is always
      spoken of as the foundation of his present political eminence. But he
      himself would say now, upon reflection, that he succeeded because the
      better sense of his auditors, from the outset, wanted him to succeed, and
      because he was lucky enough to impress a very decent and bright-witted lot
      of men with the idea that he wasn&rsquo;t a humbug.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment he was in no mood to analyze his success. His hair was
      streaming with melted snow, his throat was painfully hoarse and sore, and
      the fatigue from speaking so loud, and the reaction from his great
      excitement, combined to make him feel a very weak brother indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So utterly wearied was he that when the door of the now lighted hallway
      opened behind him, and Miss Kate herself, standing in front of the servant
      on the threshold, said: &ldquo;We want you to come in, Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; he turned
      mechanically and went in, thinking more of a drink of some sort and a
      chance to sit down beside her, than of all the possible results of his
      speech to the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of warmth and welcome inside the mansion was grateful to all
      his senses. He parted with his hat and overcoat, took the glass of claret
      which was offered him, and allowed himself to be led into the drawing-room
      and given a seat, all in a happy daze, which was, in truth, so very happy,
      that he was dimly conscious of the beginnings of tears in his eyes. It
      seemed now that the strain upon his mind and heart&mdash;the anger, and
      fright, and terrible anxiety&mdash;had lasted for whole weary years. Trial
      by soul-torture was new to him, and this ordeal through which he had
      passed left him curiously flabby and tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay back in the easy-chair in an ecstasy of physical lassitude and
      mental content, surrendering himself to the delight of watching the
      beautiful girl before him, and of listening to the music of her voice. The
      liquid depths of brown eyes into which he looked, and the soft tones which
      wooed his hearing, produced upon him vaguely the sensation of shining
      white robes and celestial harps&mdash;an indefinitely glorious recompense
      for the travail that lay behind in the valley of the shadow of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was further from him than the temptation to break this bright
      spell by speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard almost every word of what you said,&rdquo; Kate was saying. &ldquo;When you
      began we were in this room, crouched there by the window&mdash;that is,
      Ethel and I were, for mamma refused to even pretend to listen&mdash;and at
      first we thought it was one of the mob, and then Ethel recognized your
      voice. That almost annoyed me, for it seemed as if <i>I</i> should have
      been&mdash;-at least, equally quick to know it&mdash;that is, I mean, I&rsquo;ve
      heard you speak so much more than she has. And then we both hurried
      up-stairs, and lifted the window&mdash;and oh! but we listened!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from the moment we knew it was you&mdash;that you were here&mdash;we
      felt perfectly safe. It doesn&rsquo;t seem now that we were very much afraid,
      even before that, although probably we were. There was a lot of hooting,
      and that dreadful blowing on horns, and all that, and once somebody rang
      the door-bell; but, beyond throwing snowballs, nothing else was done. So I
      daresay they only wanted to scare us. Of course it was the fire that made
      us really nervous. We got that brave girl&rsquo;s warning about the mob&rsquo;s coming
      here just a little while before the sky began to redden with the blaze;
      and that sight, coming on the heels of her letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What girl? What letter?&rdquo; asked Reuben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; answered Kate, drawing a crumpled sheet of paper from her
      bosom, and reading aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Miss Minster:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just heard that a crowd of men are coming to your house to-night
      to do violent things. I am starting out to try and bring you help.
      Meanwhile, I send you my father, who will do whatever you tell him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratefully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jessica Lawton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben had risen abruptly to his feet before the signature was reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed of myself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left her out there all this
      while. And she was ill, too! There was so much else that really she
      escaped my memory altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had made his way out into the hall and taken up his hat and coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come back, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Kate asked. &ldquo;There are so many things to
      talk over, with all of us. And&mdash;and bring her too, if&mdash;if she
      will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sign of acquiescence and comprehension. Reuben darted down the
      steps and into the darkness. In a very few minutes he returned,
      disappointment written all over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone. Gedney, the man I left with the sleigh, says she went off as
      soon as I had got out of sight. I had offered to have him drive her home,
      but she refused. She&rsquo;s a curiously independent girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;But I will go over the first thing in the
      morning and thank her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t as yet know the half of what you have to thank her for,&rdquo; put in
      the lawyer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that it was so great a thing&mdash;my coming&mdash;but
      she drove all the way out to my mother&rsquo;s farm to bring me here to-night,
      and fainted when she got there. She was really ill. If her father is still
      here, I think he&rsquo;d better go at once to her place, and see about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon. Ben Lawton
      had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as the
      responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the hallway
      now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assented with readiness to Reuben&rsquo;s idea, when it was explained to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she druv out to your mother&rsquo;s place for you, did she?&rdquo; he commented,
      admiringly. &ldquo;That girl&rsquo;s a genuwine chip of the old block. I mean,&rdquo; he
      added, with an apologetic smile, &ldquo;of the old, old block. I ain&rsquo;t got so
      much git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a
      regular snorter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr. Lawton,&rdquo; said
      Kate, pleasantly, offering him her hand. &ldquo;Be sure that you tell your
      daughter, too, how grateful we all are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it
      with formal awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t seem to do much,&rdquo; he said, deprecatingly, &ldquo;and perhaps I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin&rsquo; and
      gougin&rsquo; and wras&rsquo;lin&rsquo; round generally. But you can bet your boots, ma&rsquo;am,
      that I&rsquo;d a-done what I could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps
      with a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of
      charmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate. The latter nodded,
      and then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will give me your arm,&rdquo; she said, in a delicious murmur, &ldquo;we will
      go into the dining-room. My mother and sister are waiting for us there. We
      are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have one
      to-night.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXV.&mdash;THE SHINING REWARD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he scene which
      opened upon Reuben&rsquo;s eyes was like a vista of fairyland. The dark panelled
      room, with its dim suggestions of gold frames and heavy curtains, and its
      background of palms and oleanders, contributed with the reticence of
      richness to the glowing splendor of the table in its centre. Here all
      light was concentrated&mdash;light which fell from beneath ruby shades at
      the summits of tall candles, and softened the dazzling whiteness of the
      linen, mellowed the burnished gleam of the silver plate, reflected itself
      in tender, prismatic hues from the facets of the cut-glass decanters.
      There were flowers here which gave forth still the blended fragrance of
      their hot-house home, and fragile, painted china, and all the nameless
      things of luxury which can make the breaking of bread a poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or twice
      at semi-public dinners. The thought that this higher marvel was in his
      honor intoxicated his reason. The other thought&mdash;that conceivably his
      future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted path&mdash;was
      too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even entertained. With
      an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward to self-possession.
      It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and thereafter everything
      belonged to a dream of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them to
      be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something
      disconcerting in this. Speedily enough, though, there came the reflection
      that his clothes were those in which he had raced breathlessly from the
      farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd outside, and then, all at
      once, he was at perfect ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told them&mdash;addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs. Minster, who sat at
      the head of the table, to his left&mdash;the story of Jessica&rsquo;s ride, of
      her fainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive. From this
      he drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus&mdash;he
      had sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the
      morning&mdash;and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he
      would summarily take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I can see, Mrs. Minster,&rdquo; he concluded, when the servant had
      again left the room, &ldquo;no real loss will result from this whole imbroglio.
      It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared up; for your big
      loan must really give you control of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company,
      in law. These fellows staked their majority interest in that concern to
      win your whole property in the game. They have lost, and the proceeds must
      go to you. Of course, it is not entirely clear how the matter will shape
      itself; but my notion is that you will come out winner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Minster smiled complacently. &ldquo;My daughters thought that I knew
      nothing about business!&rdquo; she said, with an air of easy triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the matter
      undiscussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?&rdquo; asked Ethel,
      from Reuben&rsquo;s right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his
      bitterness had evaporated. &ldquo;Men ought to be punished for such a crime as
      they committed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If only as a duty to the public, they should be
      prosecuted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes met,
      he read something which prompted him hastily to add:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I am in your hands in the matter. I have committed myself with
      the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished. I was
      full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to be
      punished. But it is really your question, not mine. And I may even tell
      you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage in
      settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand jury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a consideration which we won&rsquo;t discuss,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;If my mind
      were clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the
      decision for any amount of money. But my sister and I have been talking a
      great deal about this matter, and we feel&mdash;You know that Mr. Boyce
      was, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know.&rdquo; Reuben bowed his head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous
      youngster in the very forefront of everything. Until these affidavits came
      to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; urged Kate. &ldquo;Credulous is just the word. He was weak,
      foolish, vain&mdash;whatever you like. They led him into the thing. But I
      don&rsquo;t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had
      any idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us. There are reasons,&rdquo; the
      girl blushed a little, and hesitated, &ldquo;to be frank, there are reasons for
      my thinking so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful
      inflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and
      mirrored that feeling in his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite follow you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is my notion that he was deceived, at
      the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,&rdquo; responded Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is why,&rdquo; put in Ethel, &ldquo;we feel like asking you not to take the
      matter into the courts&mdash;I mean so as to put him in prison. It would
      be too dreadful to think of&mdash;to take a man who had dined at your
      house, and been boating with you, and had driven with you all over the
      Orange Mountains, picking wild-flowers for you and all that, and put him
      into prison, where he would have his hair shaved off, and tramp up and
      down on a treadmill. No; we mustn&rsquo;t do that, Mr. Tracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate added musingly: &ldquo;He has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,
      can we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; His
      heart pleaded with his brain for a lover&rsquo;s interpretation of this speech;
      and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words about
      allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a final
      decision until that had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the table
      knew that there would be no prosecutions. Upon the instant the atmosphere
      grew lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for the real thing,&rdquo; said Kate, gayly. &ldquo;I am commissioned on
      behalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our rescue
      tonight. Mamma did not hear your speech&mdash;she resolutely sat in the
      library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were in such
      a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn&rsquo;t tell her when you began&mdash;but
      she couldn&rsquo;t help hearing the horns, and she is as much obliged to you as
      we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Minster. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the police were,
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police could have done next to nothing, if they had been here,&rdquo; said
      Reuben. &ldquo;The visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and discreditable in
      its way, but I don&rsquo;t really imagine there was ever any actual danger. The
      men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works and the importation
      of the French Canadians, and I don&rsquo;t blame them; but as a body they never
      had any idea of molesting you. My own notion is that the mob was organized
      by outsiders&mdash;by men who had an end to serve in frightening you&mdash;and
      that after the crowd got here it didn&rsquo;t know what to do with itself. The
      truth is, that the mob isn&rsquo;t an American institution. Its component parts
      are too civilized, too open to appeals to reason. As soon as I told these
      people the facts in the case, they were quite ready to go, and they even
      cheered for you before they went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened
      promptly,&rdquo; said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might
      mean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuben answered resolutely: &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Minster, I did. And so they must be
      opened, on Monday. Let us be frank about the matter. It is my dearest wish
      that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business. But I
      have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to make a
      pause here possible. The very essence of the situation is that we should
      defy the trust, and throw upon it the <i>onus</i> of stopping us if it
      can. We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and who
      can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not dare to
      show fight. The force of circumstances has made me the custodian of your
      interests quite as much as of your daughters&rsquo;. I am very proud and happy
      that it is so. It is true that I have not your warrant for acting in your
      behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot now be allowed to
      make the slightest difference in my action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,&rdquo; said Ethel,
      merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their
      considerable relief Mrs. Minster concluded to smile also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been
      brought around. It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.
      The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long, was
      gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go. There
      had been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly
      along, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt that
      he fain would have had it go on forever. These delicious hours that were
      past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to minister
      to his pleasure. No word or smile or deferential glance of attention had
      been wanting to make complete the homage with which the family had chosen
      to envelop him. The sense of tender domestic intimacy had surcharged the
      very air he breathed. It had not even been necessary to keep the ball of
      talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one another, that silences
      had come as natural rests&mdash;silences more eloquent than spoken words
      could be of mutual liking and trust. The outside world had shrunk to
      nothingness. Here within this charmed circle of softened light was home.
      All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty, of romance, of
      reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it was centred. And it
      was all, all his!
    </p>
    <p>
      The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark upon
      his memory. There had been cordial, softly significant words of smiling
      leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely prompted by the
      spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone away, and he stood
      alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped. He held her hand in
      his, and there was no need for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed his
      lips upon it. There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect again, and
      through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel&rsquo;s face, pale,
      yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal dreams; and on
      this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous, trembling with the
      supreme ecstasy of a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were words spoken? Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down
      the path to the street. &ldquo;Bless you! bless you!&rdquo; was what the song-birds
      carolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had
      said, did not make itself clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his
      progress. Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the
      ether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny. Was
      there ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the
      universe?
    </p>
    <p>
      The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone. The air was
      colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of
      winter. To the lover&rsquo;s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely
      nearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which
      they burned was the same that glowed in his own heart. His senses linked
      themselves to the grand procession of the skies. The triumphant onward
      glide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was
      apparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified
      onward sweep. Oh, this&mdash;<i>this</i> was life!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a
      neighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow
      which lay thick upon the walks. There was nothing buoyant in his stride,
      and he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama spread
      overhead. With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his cane under
      his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and his brows
      bent in a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he
      passed, &ldquo;Hello, General! Pretty tough walking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and had only an
      inarticulate grunt for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night&mdash;stories
      of impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions&mdash;and
      General Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart. That Horace
      had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only too
      evident. Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal roof,
      his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but indulgence
      now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and quip and
      pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him like a
      pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful weakness.
      Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and to their
      burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked disgrace was
      coming as well. Precisely what it was, he knew not; but winks and nods and
      unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when he came in had been in
      the air about him all the evening. The very vagueness of the fear lent it
      fresh terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path
      which encircled the small yard to reach the front door. He cursorily noted
      the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the snow, and
      took it for granted that one of the servants had been out late.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the
      lower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which gave
      even his martial nerves a start. The dark-clad figure of a woman,
      obviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and
      arms bent under against his very door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource. In an instant
      he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped it, and
      sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the reverberating
      clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house. Then, unlocking the
      door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up the gas, and
      disposed the inanimate form on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very ill&mdash;perhaps
      dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for
      Dr. Lester, who lived only a block or so away.

      CHAPTER XXXVI.&mdash;&ldquo;I TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>nstead of snow and
      cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed by stormy night, here were
      light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet volatile sense of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica&rsquo;s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a
      gigantic rose hanging directly over her head. Her brain received no
      impression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the
      slightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all. Even when it
      finally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink
      leaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward
      understanding it. The transformation went on with infinite slowness before
      her vacantly contented vision. Upon all sides the outer leaves gradually,
      little by little, stretched themselves downward, still downward, until
      they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted lily. Indefinite
      spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely apparent that faint
      designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered over these large
      environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came through them. With
      measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at its disposal, this vast
      floral cone revealed itself at last to her dim consciousness as being made
      of some thin, figured cloth. It seemed weeks&mdash;months&mdash;before she
      further comprehended that the rose above her was the embroidered centre of
      a canopy, and that the leaves depending from it in long, graceful curves
      about her were bed-curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at it.
      It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at all. From
      the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of a man&rsquo;s
      silk night-shirt. She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve, and
      thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not to be
      hers. The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light flashed
      in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she looked again, an elderly, broad-figured man with a florid face
      was standing close beside the bed, gazing with anxiety upon her. She knew
      that it was General Boyce, and for a long time was not surprised that he
      should be there. The capacity for wondering, for thinking about things,
      seemed not to exist in her brain. She looked at him calmly and did not
      dream of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better?&rdquo; she heard him eagerly whisper. &ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The complex difficulty of two questions which required separate answers
      troubled her remotely. She made some faint nodding motion of her head and
      eyes, and then lay perfectly still again. She could hear the sound of her
      own breathing&mdash;a hoarse, sighing sound, as if of blowing through a
      comb&mdash;and, now that it was suggested to her, there was a deadened
      heavy ache in her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still placidly surveying the General, she began to be conscious of
      remembering things. The pictures came slowly, taking form with a fantastic
      absence of consecutive meaning, but they gradually produced the effect of
      a recollection upon her mind. The starting point&mdash;and everything else
      that went before that terrible sinking, despairing struggle through the
      wet snow&mdash;was missing. She recalled most vividly of all being seized
      with a sudden crisis of swimming giddiness and choking&mdash;her throat
      and chest all afire with the tortures of suffocation. It was under a
      lamp-post, she remembered; and when the vehement coughing was over, her
      mouth was full of blood, and there were terrifying crimson spatters on the
      snow. She had stood aghast at this, and then fallen to weeping piteously
      to herself with fright. How strange it was&mdash;in the anguish of that
      moment she had moaned out, &ldquo;O mother, mother!&rdquo; and yet she had never seen
      that parent, and had scarcely thought of her memory even for many, many
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she had blindly staggered on, sinking more than once from sheer
      exhaustion, but still forcing herself forward, her wet feet weighing like
      leaden balls, and fierce agonies clutching her very heart. She had fallen
      in the snow at the very end of her journey; had dragged herself
      laboriously, painfully, up on to the steps, and had beaten feebly on the
      panels of the door with her numbed hands, making an inarticulate moan
      which not all her desperate last effort could lift into a cry; and then
      there had come, with a great downward swoop of skies and storm, utter
      blackness and collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes now in the weariness which this effort at recollection
      had caused. Her senses wandered off, unbidden, unguided, to a dream of the
      buzzing of a bee upon a window-pane, which was somehow like the stertorous
      sound of her own breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bee&mdash;a big, loud, foolish fellow, with yellow fur upon his broad
      back and thighs&mdash;had flown into the schoolroom, and had not wit
      enough to go out again. Some of the children were giggling over this, but
      she would not join them because Mr. Tracy, the schoolmaster upon the
      platform, did not wish it. She wanted very much to please him. Already she
      delighted in the hope that he liked her better than he did some of the
      other girls&mdash;scornful girls who came from wealthy homes, and wore
      better dresses than any of the despised Lawton brood could ever hope to
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silk dresses, opened boldly at the throat, and with long trains tricked
      out with imitation garlands. They were worn now by older girls&mdash;hard-faced,
      jealous, cruel creatures&mdash;and these sat in a room with lace curtains
      and luxurious furniture. And some laughed with a ring like brass in their
      voices, and some wept furtively in comers, and some cursed their God and
      all living things; and there was the odor of wine and the uproar of the
      piano, and over all a great, ceaseless shame and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Escape from this should be made at all hazards; and the long, incredibly
      fearful flight, with pursuit always pressing hot upon her, the evil fangs
      of the wolf-pack snapping in the air all about her frightened ears, led to
      a peaceful, soft-carpeted forest, where the low setting sun spread a red
      light among the big tree-trunks. Against this deep, far-distant sky there
      was the figure of a man coming. For him she waited with a song in her
      heart. Did she not know him? It was Reuben Tracy, and he was too gentle
      and good not to see her when he passed. She would call out to him&mdash;and
      lo! she could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace was with her, and held her hand; and they both gazed with terrified
      longing after Tracy, and could not cry out to him for the awful dumbness
      that was on them. And when he, refusing to see them, spread out his arms
      in anger, the whole great forest began to sway and circle dizzily, and
      huge trees toppled, rocks crashed downward, gaunt giant reptiles rose from
      yawning caves with hideous slimy eyes in a lurid ring about her. And she
      would save Horace with her life, and fought like mad, bleeding and maimed
      and frenzied, until the weight of mountains piled upon her breast held her
      down in helpless, choking horror. Then only came the power to scream, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the roar of confusion and darkness came suddenly a hush and the
      return of light. She was lying in the curtained bed, and a tender hand was
      pressing soft cool linen to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening her eyes in tranquil weakness, she saw two men standing at her
      bedside. He who held the cloth in his hand was Dr. Lester, whom she
      remembered very well. The other&mdash;he whose head was bowed, and whose
      eyes were fastened upon hers with a pained and affrighted gaze&mdash;was
      Horace Boyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her soul she smiled at him, but no answering softness came to his
      harrowed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told your father everything,&rdquo; she heard the doctor say in a low tone.
      &ldquo;I recognized her on the instant. I happened to have attended her, by the
      merest chance, when her child was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her child?&rdquo; the other asked, in the same low, far-away voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and your child. He is in Thessaly now, a boy nearly six years
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! I never knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have taken precious good care not to know,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      with grave dislike. &ldquo;This is the time and place to speak plainly to you,
      Boyce. This poor girl has come to her death through the effort to save you
      from disgrace. She supposed you lived here, and dragged herself here to
      help you.&rdquo; Jessica heard the sentence of doom without even a passing
      thought. Every energy left in her feebly fluttering brain was concentrated
      upon the question, <i>Is</i> he saved? Vaguely the circumstances of the
      papers, of the threats against Horace, of her desires and actions, seemed
      to come back to her memory. She waited in dazed suspense to hear what
      Horace would say; but he only hung his head the lower, and left the doctor
      to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She raved for hours last night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after the women had got her to
      bed, and we had raised her out of the comatose state, about saving you
      from State prison. First she would plead with Tracy, then she would appeal
      to you to fly, and so backwards and forwards, until she wore herself out.
      The papers she had got hold of&mdash;they must have slipped out of
      Gedney&rsquo;s pocket into the sleigh. I suppose you know that I took them back
      to Tracy this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Horace made no answer, but bent that crushed and vacant gaze upon
      her face. She marvelled that he could not see she was awake and conscious,
      and still more that the strength and will to speak were withheld from her.
      The dreadful pressure upon her breast was making itself felt again, and
      the painful sound of the labored breathing took on the sombre rhythm of a
      distant death-chant. Oh, would he never speak! No: still the doctor went
      on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tracy will be here in a few minutes. He&rsquo;s terribly upset by the thing,
      and has gone first to tell the news at the Minsters&rsquo;. Do you want to see
      him when he comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I want,&rdquo; said Horace, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, I would go straight to him and say frankly, &lsquo;I have been a
      damned fool, and a still damneder hypocrite, and I throw myself on your
      mercy.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s the tenderest-hearted man alive, and this sight here will
      move him. Upon my word, I can hardly keep the tears out of my eyes
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jessica saw as through a mist that these two men&rsquo;s faces, turned upon her,
      were softened with a deep compassion. Then suddenly the power to speak
      came to her. It was a puny and unnatural voice which fell upon her ears&mdash;low
      and hoarsely grating, and the product of much pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away&mdash;doctor,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Leave him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace sat softly upon the edge of the bed, and gathered her two hands
      tenderly in his. He did not attempt to keep back the tears which welled to
      his eyes, nor did he try to talk. Thus they were together for what seemed
      a long time, surrounded by a silence which was full of voices to them
      both. A wan smile settled upon her face as she held him in her intent
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the boy,&rdquo; she whispered at last; &ldquo;he is Horace, too. Don&rsquo;t let him
      lie&mdash;ever&mdash;to any girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man groaned in spite of himself, and for answer gently pressed
      her hands. &ldquo;I promise you that, Jess,&rdquo; he said, after a time, in a broken
      voice. He bent over and kissed her on the forehead. The damp roughness of
      the skin chilled and terrified him, but the radiance on her face deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hurts&mdash;to breathe,&rdquo; she said, after a time with a glance of
      affectionate apology in her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subdued noises were faintly heard now in the hallway outside, and
      presently the door was opened cautiously, and a tall new figure entered
      the room. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Reuben Tracy tiptoed his way to the
      bedside, and stood gravely behind and above his former partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she conscious?&rdquo; he asked of Boyce, in a tremulous whisper; and Horace,
      bending his head still lower, murmured between choking sobs: &ldquo;It is Mr.
      Tracy, Jess, come to say&mdash;to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes brightened with intelligence. &ldquo;Good&mdash;good,&rdquo; she said,
      slowly, as if musing to herself. The gaze which she fastened upon Reuben&rsquo;s
      face was strangely full of intense meaning, and he felt it piercing his
      very heart. Minutes went by under the strain of this deep, half-wild,
      appealing look. At last she spoke, with a greater effort at distinctness
      than before, and in a momentarily clearer tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were always kind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt&mdash;my boy. Shake hands
      with him&mdash;for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young men obeyed mechanically, after an instant&rsquo;s pause, and
      without looking at each other. Neither had eyes save for the white face on
      the pillows in front of them, and for the gladdened, restful light which
      spread softly over it as their hands touched in amity before her vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she seemed no longer to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the languor of peace which had come to possess her, even the sense of
      pain in breathing was gone. There were shadowy figures on the retina of
      her brain, but they conveyed no idea save of general beatitude to her
      mind. The space in which her senses floated was radiant and warm and full
      of formless beauty. Various individuals&mdash;types of her loosening ties
      to life&mdash;came and went almost unheeded in this daze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda, vehemently weeping, and holding the little fair-haired, wondering
      boy over the bed for her final kiss, passed away like a dissolving mist.
      Her father&rsquo;s face, too, dawned upon this dream, tear-stained and woful,
      and faded again into nothingness. Other flitting apparitions there were,
      even more vague and brief, melting noiselessly into the darkened hush.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unclouded calm of this lethargy grew troubled presently when there
      fell upon her dulled ear the low tones of a remembered woman&rsquo;s voice.
      Enough of consciousness flickered up to tell her whose it was. She
      strained her eyes in the gathering shadows to see Kate Minster, and began
      restlessly to roll her head upon the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where&mdash;<i>her?</i>&rdquo; she moaned, striving to stretch
      forth her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lifted and held softly in a tender grasp, and she felt as well a
      compassionate stroking touch laid upon her forehead. The gentle magnetism
      of these helped the dying girl to bring into momentary being the image of
      a countenance close above hers&mdash;a dark, beautiful face, all melting
      now with affection and grief. She smiled faintly into this face, and lay
      still again for a long time. The breathing grew terribly shorter and more
      labored, the light faded.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
